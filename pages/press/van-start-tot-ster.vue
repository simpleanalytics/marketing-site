          Bart Sprenkels (00:00):

        <p class="mt-0">
          Welcome and it’s great that you’re watching or listening to this new
          episode of Van Start tot Ster. This is the video podcast of
          Onderneming Panel where I speak with experienced and successful
          entrepreneurs, with the goal of learning as much as possible as a
          starting entrepreneur. Today at my table is someone others describe as
          a serial entrepreneur. I’ll later ask him if he identifies with that
          and what it really means. But he is very impressive and, above all,
          very open about working on a company called Simple Analytics. It’s a
          competitor to Google Analytics, where you can measure who is on your
          website and which pages they visit in a privacy-safe way. And what I
          find especially interesting is the way he builds it, his mindset about
          entrepreneurship and, of course, the substance of the companies. So
          today here in our studio, Iron Brands Iron. Welcome!
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:01):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Yes, thanks! And thanks for the intro!</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:01):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Yeah, no problem.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:01):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Competitor to Google Analytics. Nice! I believe so. I don’t know if
          they already know we exist, so we’re not that big yet. But how many
          users do you have? Uh, well, I think we now have around 1,400 paying
          customers, but we’ve also just launched a free plan, and that is
          getting close to 15,000 users who are now using it on their website.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:02):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Has it recently reached 15,000?</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:02):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          We already had some users who were using it for free in a certain way,
          but now we have really launched it and started pushing it. And now you
          can see that. Yeah, it really stopped many people from supporting the
          idea that we were going to compete with Google Analytics – that it was
          a free product – and we were going to charge for it, plus you can do a
          lot less with it.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:02):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">And that was the pitch. Thanks for watching.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:02):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          That was a tough pitch, and now we see that we’ve made a version that
          we’ve kind of, well, capped in terms of what you can do with it, but
          which we can still offer as a sort of free version to users. And then
          you see that, oh yeah, people are quite willing to test it, use it,
          and see if they want to replace Google Analytics.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:02):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, your competitors are very modest. In another interview I saw of
          you, you mentioned that you haven’t yet taken any market share from
          them.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:03):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          No. Yeah, I think if you look at the analytics market – like a pie
          chart – you see that 90% of the websites using an analytics tool are
          still on Google Analytics. And I think we’re at 0.0001%. That’s a very
          small share of the market.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:03):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Yeah, but still a whole load of users.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:03):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yes. Definitely. And it’s heading in the right direction. And it’s
          growing very fast. And well, we’re just the two of us, so you don’t
          need, uh, 10% of the market share to run a good business.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:03):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          What I really appreciate is that you’re very open about having a goal.
          With you I actually learned the term “Erg”. I looked it up, because
          you share on LinkedIn how much revenue your companies are making. And
          Simple Analytics is at – I have it noted as – $414,000 ARR, and ARR is
          annual recurring revenue.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:04):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Yeah, exactly.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:04):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Recurring revenue. And what’s the goal?</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:04):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          1 million. Yeah, that’s the goal. And then we also went back a bit,
          because Adriaan actually started Simple Analytics. He’s my partner – a
          developer and, let’s say, a privacy enthusiast. And five years ago he
          just ran into the problem that everyone kept pasting Google Analytics
          on their website left and right. And well, there are quite a few
          drawbacks to that, especially when you look at it from a privacy
          perspective. And he was like, “That can’t be right!” And it’s also
          incredibly complex for many people to actually use that tool. And 90%
          of people use only 5% of its features. So he was like, “Why can’t I
          just build a very simple, basic replacement for Google Analytics that
          still gives you the insights you want to see, but complies with all
          the regulations and doesn’t track everyone and everything all the
          time?”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:05):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Well, as some developers do when they have problems, they build a
          solution themselves. So he built it, and I wasn’t even on the scene
          yet, and then he launched it. And then many companies – and also
          developers with websites – came by saying, “Ah, I need this because I
          don’t need all that extra stuff.” And it’s true – it’s just not
          privacy-unfriendly, and, well, Google… we have the European
          regulations, and Google doesn’t really care about that. And so then
          the first hundred users came along who were like, “Hey, this is a pain
          point and you’re solving it.” And that’s how it started growing
          organically. I joined later, and then we agreed, “If we’re going to
          grow, what is our goal?”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:06):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Just say something.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:06):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">The target?</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:06):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Basically, what would we want? And you can go off in all directions
          and raise funding – you see LinkedIn full of posts like, “Oh, raised
          so much funding!” – but ultimately, you just want to run a good
          business where you have the freedom to put your heart into it and make
          a good living. A business that fits your life and what you want to
          achieve. And then we asked ourselves that, and came to the conclusion:
          it would be really nice if we could run a business that makes 1
          million. We had to come up with a number: that’s the target – 1
          million per year.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:07):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Yeah.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:07):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          And, well, in the software business that’s actually a pretty great
          goal. Because software is scalable, but also hard to get off the
          ground. Look, if you’re making 1 million per year in a software
          company – and it’s just the two of us with not too many other costs –
          then that would be an amazing goal to achieve. So we’re almost halfway
          there; we’re still on track.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:07):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Yeah, nice! Did you also set a timeframe?</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:07):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yes, within five years. And within five years? Well, because when I
          joined Adriaan, it went like this: Adriaan founded the company and
          grew it until he was making eight or nine thousand per month. Then it
          stabilized a bit. But that was because Adriaan is an engineer – he
          only wanted to do engineering stuff, work on the product, and
          definitely not deal with marketing or sales. And I had just come out
          of another company that I had founded – but I’ll get to that later.
          You probably have questions about that.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:08):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Yeah, definitely.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:08):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          And then I got to know Adriaan and we agreed – I once called him after
          a while and said, “Shouldn’t you find a business partner who handles
          everything except building the product, so you can focus on product
          development, while the business grows?” Because that growth is a
          necessary component: building and growing. And that growth wasn’t
          happening. Well, then I got involved. When he said he had reached 10K
          per month, we said, “Okay, it’s already at 10K per month, and from
          here we need to get to, what, 80K per month within five years?” And we
          are now at – well, it was 3435, and we’ve been at it for two years, so
          cool! It’s still heading in the right direction.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:08):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Those are good signals too, because it’s often about validating an
          idea – when do you actually have something worthwhile? And if Adriaan
          could grow it to 10K per month just by building the product without
          even thinking about how to reach as many people as possible or who
          will use it, that’s a great sign.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:09):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          10K per month. The hardest part is already done, really. Yes, in
          principle going from zero to one is a lot harder than going from one
          to ten.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:09):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          What was that book called again? Zero to One? Who is that by again?
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:09):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Uh.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:09):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Mr. Thiel?</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:09):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yes, Pieter Thiel. Zero to One. That’s the hardest part. Because there
          are so many… I think it’s always about trying something. I think a lot
          of people get stuck there. Everyone, I mean, everyone has ideas.
          Everyone you meet comes up with business ideas. Everyone thinks, “Oh,
          that would be a good business idea.” But then actually translating
          your idea into action – going and doing something – try to build
          something around that concept, and 90% of it just falls apart. And
          then there are those who remain and actually do something – they
          either create a website or build their product. And then there’s the
          point where, okay, that’s already something. But then try to get
          someone to pay for it.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:10):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Yes.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:10):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          And that’s it. How do you go from zero to one? And many people mess
          that part up, because it’s really hard. In my first business, you
          built something and then went to a customer and said, “This costs
          €1,000 per year,” and the customer said, “€1,000.” And then you think,
          “Oh yeah, but what do you actually do?” And how many customers do you
          have? We had five customers, and yeah, but it was all still in the
          early stages. You really have to come from a strong background to
          convince someone to pay for your service or product or whatever. And
          that’s what Adriaan managed to do.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:10):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">How? How so? Do you know that?</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:10):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yes. So, uh, now we’re quickly moving into the nerd corner of the
          internet. Okay? Briefly about Adriaan: You built it and then launched
          on Hacker News and Reddit – sites with huge traffic – where lots of
          engineers hang out sharing things. So Adriaan shared, “Hey, I’ve built
          this and we’re launching now, and if you want, give it a try.” And
          that sparked an initial spike where people said, “Wow, this is
          awesome.” And then our first users came along. They told other users,
          “I ditched Google Analytics, now I use this – you should use it too,
          it’s awesome.” And that’s how Adriaan got his first customers without
          doing any marketing, which was a signal to me that I thought, holy
          shit, there’s something there.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:11):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, because he probably also happened to tell it to a group of
          people who cared about privacy and knew all the downsides of Google
          Analytics at the time.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:12):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          But above all, he built it himself – and that’s often the best way to
          build a business because he encountered the problem firsthand.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:12):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Yeah, for himself.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:12):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          And he wanted to solve that problem for himself, because he didn’t
          understand why everyone kept putting Google Analytics on their
          website.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:12):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Almost as common as WordPress hosting, Google Analytics.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:12):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yes, and not stopping to consider what impact that has and what it
          means for the users visiting your website. So he ran into this
          problem, and he built a solution for himself. Not like, “Oh, I have an
          idea, I’m going to build a solution.” No, he built a solution for the
          problem he was facing. And eventually he shared it within a community
          of people just like him – because he was always hanging out on Hacker
          News and Reddit. So in the end, it’s kind of a natural process why
          Simple Analytics came into being. And I think that’s often the best
          way companies get started.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:13):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, it’s really great. You don’t have to force ideas or products
          that perhaps nobody really wants.

        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, I think that’s often the case. I remember when I started, I just
          knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur. I didn’t care what I did, because
          being an entrepreneur is cool – you don’t have to work for a boss. But
          then, what are you going to do? “No idea.” Then you start coming up
          with ideas. But that isn’t the right way. You end up with things like,
          “Let’s build the Airbnb for cats,” and that kind of stuff. We ended up
          with Stage Platform because I was an intern at the time. That was the
          only reason Stage Platform was built. Um, but yeah. And in the end, it
          went pretty well.

        <p class="mt-0">
          I was just about to say, I have a number here, but since you share
          everything so openly, that Stage Platform – which is called Fix – is
          active, I believe, in Amsterdam and the surrounding area. That’s where
          it’s mostly big.

          Iron Brands (00:14):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, so it’s recurring as well. ARR is always important, because
          people pay monthly or yearly – usually small amounts – but when you
          add them up, you get a decent sum. And it comes back every year, as it
          should, because if customers are happy, they stick around.

          Let’s take one step back – you studied, right? First International
          Business, then Sustainable Finance. Both in Maastricht. You’re
          originally from Maastricht.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">

        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          It seems so. I’ve heard that. You studied, and I’m curious how you
          ended up… I can imagine if you study finance, you’d go look for a job
          and start working. But somewhere you decided, “Entrepreneurship is
          cool and I want to do that.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:15):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yes, that's right, but that finance study had partly to do with it.
          Because, you know, I come from Maastricht and I've always been someone
          who followed the traditional path. So I went to high school. I did
          VWO. Then it was expected that you would go to university. Well, then
          we study. Then you do international business. Nice and broad, because
          then you don't have any
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:15):

          Iron Brands (00:15):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          to decide, no real choices to make. And after that? Then it went, “Oh
          shit, you have to make a choice, right?” Well, then just do finance,
          because you'll end up in a good place with that. So I chose Finance,
          did Finance. Then you had to do an internship, and suddenly everything
          became serious. So I also went, all suited up, as an intern to work at
          a finance consultant. And then I realized, holy shit, this is so
          boring. But this, this, this is not it. There must be more in life
          than this. And honestly, I had a nice internship and met nice people,
          but that's when I realized, wow, this just isn’t it. And then you
          really start looking, “Oh yeah, what else then?” And I pretty quickly
          figured out, oh well, maybe startups, maybe that's something. Because
          it was portrayed as cool in the media. I thought, well, that must be
          cool.

          Iron Brands (00:16):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          So it was never like, “Oh, you know, it’s been instilled in you from
          birth, like your father is an entrepreneur or your whole family is,”
          and then you just follow that. And that, that wasn’t it. It was only
          when I discovered what I didn’t like that I started investigating what
          was right. And then, through connections, I got an internship at a
          startup. Then I realized, oh, I think that’s entrepreneurship. You can
          just start a company, apparently. And then? Well, then you can do
          amazing things. And that’s when it all began.

        <p class="mt-0">
          Yes, but often it's like—I could now tell stories about always being
          meant to be an entrepreneur and all that—but no, it's not like that.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:16):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          No, but I mean, you can simply register and say, “I'm going to be an
          entrepreneur,” and you just go for it. It's really that simple. But it
          feels intimidating for many.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:17):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yes. Yes. No, but that only hit me after that finance internship, when
          I then did an internship with another entrepreneur. And that was in a
          very small team of four people. And then? You become very involved.
          You kind of already feel like an entrepreneur. But then you don't take
          on the risks, yet you're continuously working together to get that
          company off the ground. It didn’t work out, by the way—the company no
          longer exists—but I got a lot of ideas from it, like, “Wow, you can
          just do this.” And if you have an idea, you can register with the
          Chamber of Commerce and build a website. And then you're essentially
          being an entrepreneur, I suppose. So the barrier always felt very high
          for me—like, “Oh, I'm studying Finance and climbing that career ladder
          to become an entrepreneur.” There’s still so much in between. But for
          me, it was really just that step of, “Hey, I'm going to see what the
          world of startups is like.”

        <p class="mt-0">
          And then it became entrepreneurship. Because really, it’s just a small
          step.

          So that internship you did, which you mentioned when you were an
          intern—that was at that startup. And then you thought, “I want to be
          an entrepreneur,” and then you started Fix.

          It was just that—I did that internship at that startup and it worked
          out. But then I got the idea, “Oh, we could start a business.” No idea
          what we would do. Um. And then I was with a friend of mine, with whom
          I was also living. He was somewhat similar—already in the same
          vein—and also quite complementary, because I felt more like a
          marketing/business/sales person and he was more on the design side. So
          I thought, “Okay, we know each other well, we get along, we have
          similar ideas and are somewhat complementary. Shouldn't we just start
          a business together?” And then we had another one—a guy, our friend.
          And he did data science and said, “Yeah, but you can also program.”
          Yes, that's good. And then, “Okay, what are we going to do? Well,
          shall we start an internship platform?”

        <p class="mt-0">
          Yes, zero validation. We just went ahead and built it and then, when
          we agreed on it together, we really thought, “Okay, this is going to
          be—this is going to be the new Uber. This is really going to be huge,
          and we're going to raise funding and, yeah, open an office.”

          Yes, and then you realize that in reality, things turn out very
          differently. But in the end, we did—and I’m pretty proud that we, as
          three people fresh out of school, went and built it. Zero validation,
          zero ideas, not even a proper email ever written in my life—and then
          you go and build a business and actually hold it together, because in
          three years we grew to, yes, €100,000 per year. Fortunately, it
          doesn’t cost much; running an online internship platform doesn’t have
          high costs. We managed to survive for three years on very low wages.
          And yes, the company still exists. It works. And so my partner, with
          whom I started, still runs it, and, well, it's going well.

          Yes, because in the end you learn so much from it. And I think this
          has been the foundation that allowed me—with Simple Analytics and
          later with my other company—to know a bit about how things should be
          done, because I mostly know how not to do it and you end up falling
          into every pitfall. Have you ever been hit by one? So next time it’ll
          go a lot faster. Or you can validate faster, or you can better assess

          Yes, well, basically everything. Just try to get your first customers
          with your internship platform and you'll find that you get turned down
          a hundred times before it finally clicks—and then you start to
          understand why people say no, and how you could get people to say yes
          a little sooner. And also that you end up making budgets and pitch
          decks and realize that it’s all really bullshit.

          Yes. Yes, but you're just okay. Yes, maybe—maybe. I think the pitch
          deck is 90% of the pitch. I think that's bullshit. And, can you
          explain why? But you just end up getting caught up in things—lots of
          thinking, lots of dreaming. But actually, when you look at reality,
          there are just other things needed. And of course, with that
          internship platform we couldn’t raise any funding, but then we spent
          three weeks hammering out a pitch deck.

          you have to experience it; you have to run into it. I see
          people—everyone always wants to be an entrepreneur. Everyone finds the
          image of an entrepreneur very sexy. But can you really say that works
          out? It works out a lot better than you think. Um. But yes, everyone
          is mostly focused on strategy and thinking about how to make it big or
          what my pitch should look like, and then we can raise funding, and
          then, yes, that’s all just part of it. Or making a budget. Yes, a
          budget—you can scrap it after a month. Of course. I understand that if
          you're further along, you want to look ahead and make investments. But
          when you're just starting out, you really don't need a budget. And if
          you get caught up in that...

          because it doesn’t add up—and you end up spending a lot of time on it
          anyway. So yes, all those lessons from those three years, and then you
          go work on your new company. You definitely take that with you, and I
          can imagine. So that's why, above all, try this at home, because you
          learn so much from it. And if you don’t do that “try this at home”
          and, if I hadn’t done Fix, then I would have just been stuck reading

          and so on. But in the end, something has to be produced, and you just

        <p class="mt-0">
          So you learned, um, a lot. Three very educational years at Fiks. Yeah.
          And then you met Adriaan, right? Because you didn’t know him yet, you
          said you weren’t in the picture, and he had already started with
          Simple Analytics. So, how did that go? You can’t just knock on
          someone's door and say, “Hey, can I join in?” Back then...
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:24):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          No. No, that's right. Um. So after three years of Fix, I was a bit
          done with it. And by that I mean we thought we were going to become
          the biggest company in the Netherlands, but in the end, that wasn’t
          the case. And we did have a good company, and it was running—and it
          still is. Um. But I felt like it was two steps forward, one step back,
          and it didn’t have that hockeystick growth you’re looking for. And we
          ran into all sorts of things where, um, well, some things couldn’t be
          built because we didn’t have the knowledge in-house and we just
          started as a team of three. It’s fun to do business with friends, but
          at a certain point I wanted to move on, and then I made the choice for
          myself of, “Yeah, I think I need to look for something different
          because I have a different ambition and want to go in a different
          direction.” And that was very difficult.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:25):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          It was also pretty painful, because you know, we were doing business.
          I was doing business with my friends, so yes, we all had contracts and
          everything was arranged very professionally. But yes, you get very
          close, and some people have a different idea about business, and
          fortunately we all ended up okay. But that was a difficult period, and
          then I started wondering, “Okay, with all the baggage and knowledge
          I've gained over these past three years, what do I really want?” And
          then I realized that I really wanted to be more on the software side
          and work with someone who was very technical and had a product.
          Because at Fix, we had a platform—we had a website—but we were
          basically just selling internships, and sometimes we got customers who
          were angry because the quality of an intern wasn’t good. And I, well,
          I didn’t have that in my control, so to speak.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:26):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          We were just the matchmaker, and in the end, you had to assess whether
          the intern fit your company, etc. But I found it very difficult not
          having control over the quality of my product. So then I thought,
          “Okay, I just want to go the software route, because then we can
          create a scalable solution and the person who wants to buy it will
          know what they're buying. Because here’s the product, and it costs €10
          a month or €100 a month. It doesn’t matter, but then you get that.” So
          that’s what I was really looking for. But I also knew that I would
          never be able to build that myself. So I did try taking software
          courses, but, well, that wasn’t for me.

          Get into it? Yes, there’s a course called “Honderd Days of No Code.”
          But in the end, that led me to a little circle in Amsterdam with
          people who actually make software themselves—in that hacker scene,
          sort of. That’s also an umbrella term for it. And then I got more into
          it and started going to some drinks events, also to meet people who
          were in that field. And at one of those events, I ran into Adriaan,
          and I asked, “So, what do you do then?” Well, that’s a story in
          itself.

          incredibly cool. And then I asked him, “So, how do you get your
          customers? And how do you do it? How does it work?” And he said, “No
          idea. They just come.” And then I thought, “Okay, I need to be a part
          of this.” And well, that was kind of simultaneous with me leaving Fix.
          And when it was completely clear that this was more my thing, I just
          grabbed a phone, called him, and said, “Hey, remember me? Three months
          ago at that drinks event?”

          A long time. Yes. Um, yes. Do you remember me? And don't you just look
          for a business partner who handles the business side? And then he said
          yes. When we had that conversation, I thought, “That really clicked
          for me too,” because he was really struggling with the fact that he
          needed to stabilize at some point. And then he knew he had to do
          marketing, but that just wasn’t in him.

          Every day he would wake up with a knot in his stomach thinking, “Oh
          shit, actually I have to do marketing, but I just don’t feel like it.
          I just want to build things.” So very soon after, it was like, “Okay,
          then let’s not even have a coffee meeting.” And well, one thing led to
          another, even though we didn’t know each other at the time. That was a
          risk especially for him, because he was letting me into his company,
          but also for me, because I was about to invest my time and energy. So
          what I said to him was, “You know what? I’m going to work for you for
          three months for free, full days. And during those three months, you
          can fire me at any time—no strings attached. Just shake my hand. If
          you don’t think it works, for any reason, then we won’t do it.”

        <p class="mt-0">
          But if after three months you still think, “Alright, we should do
          this,” then you have to take into account that I am an entrepreneur
          too and I also want a big share of the pie. So if you’re open to that,
          then we’ll do it. You can cancel at any time, but after three months,
          if you want to continue, then we really become partners and
          co-entrepreneurs in this business. Naturally, after those three months
          we both realized we just had to do it.

          with your friends and housemates at Fix—people you know very well and
          know how they are and communicate—to working with a guy you met at a
          drinks event.

          And then, after about three months of a trial period, did you get what

        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah. Well, and vice versa too, because I also worked with him for
          three months. I wanted to see if I liked it, if it worked. And you
          often notice after three months, “Okay, this works or this doesn’t.”
          And we both immediately realized that it worked. And since then, well,
          we made a contract and agreed on everything. You wanted to be an
          entrepreneur, right? So what about the percentages? We figured that
          out very quickly. Since then, we’ve had contracts tucked away and
          haven’t looked back, just moving forward.

        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, yeah. You do need a contract. I would recommend everyone to
          hammer one out—get it completely locked down business-wise. Because if
          you have to part ways later, it makes things a lot easier. You just
          have a contract that says, “This is what we agreed on,” and then you
          shake hands and walk away. And sometimes it’s not so easy at all.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-0">
          But yeah, not often, but sometimes things just fall apart. We’ve had
          falling outs with business partners—like with Go Founders.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:31):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, but then it’s really good to have something on paper.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:31):

        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Just in case you encounter these kinds of situations. At Fix we also
          had a contract. The harder part was that I felt very emotionally
          involved with the company, since I had founded it myself and it didn’t
          turn out exactly as I had hoped. And then you have to distance
          yourself—and in a business sense, from your friends. That makes it
          very personal, and it makes parting ways much harder. Look, if Adriaan
          and I now get into an argument or can’t see eye to eye, we just have
          the contract. We’ve become good friends, but initially we are business
          partners, and if something happens, the contract clearly states what
          happens in situations x, y, and z.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:32):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Yeah, and then it makes it a lot easier to split up.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:32):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, but I always find those conversations difficult—when you’re
          drafting and hammering things together, you really need a good
          carpenter, I think.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:32):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah. Well, there are people who are good at that and enjoy it. But,
          um, we only did that after the three-month period, because you don’t
          want to start with that. It’s very important, and you know it will
          have to come eventually—just like an equity split and things like
          that. But I just said, “I think this is a really interesting
          opportunity to work with you, and I’m willing to take some risk by
          working for you for three months for free. And if you don’t like it,
          then I’m out and that’s my lost time and energy. But if it works, then
          we start with the fun part—working together and building a bond. And
          after three months, if we both think, ‘This is super nice,’ then we
          know, ‘Okay, we really like it, this is great,’ and then we have to
          agree on the next steps.”

          Iron Brands (00:33):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, but if you start by negotiating every little detail and
          percentages before you even begin working together, I don’t think
          that’s a good start.

        <p class="mt-0">
          No. And that’s also nice because after those three months you both
          have built up goodwill. You both want to continue, so then those
          discussions become a bit easier, I think. You still have a company—you

          Um. And I won’t go into all the details of what it does, but it’s a
          hosting service. We host a UniFi controller—and a UniFi controller is
          basically a kind of dashboard that manages your WiFi devices.
          Installation companies need those dashboards. And we host it on a
          server, and those installation companies—the MSPs—pay us monthly to do
          that. I’d never heard of that before. But this is a similar situation
          I ended up in with Adriaan. It all came about because of Simple
          Analytics. Adriaan, I wanted an office, and we have an office in
          Amsterdam with just the two of us, and the office is pretty big, so we
          set up a bunch of desks there and invited people from the local nerd
          community in Amsterdam, saying, “Hey, we have desks here if you’re
          working on cool, interesting tech projects.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:35):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Well, I just sit there and rent a desk for €250 a month, and you kind
          of have colleagues even though they’re not really your colleagues.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:35):

        <p class="mt-0">Yeah.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:35):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          So there are now eight people there, and everyone is busy with their
          own projects. And I know how those people came together—it was simple.
          I posted on Twitter, and someone replied, “I’m in Amsterdam too; why
          not come by sometime?” That person had a desk and said, “I also have a
          friend—can he come too?” And he did. One of those guys was Dries.
          Dries worked as a software engineer at a development agency, and he
          was doing it on the side, just tinkering with projects.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:36):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Like, they really know how to do it.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:36):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah. So I went over to Dries and said, “So, what exactly are you
          working on? Tell me about it.” And he started explaining what he was
          doing. He began it because he wanted to try it himself once, but then
          he discovered that hosting the UniFi controller is incredibly
          difficult. And then I thought, “Yeah, several people are bound to run
          into that problem. I can’t do that.” I mean, building a solution that
          automates that part and takes the hosting burden off—you know, because
          he just didn’t get it. And then I said, “Dries, I think this is just a
          business.” And then it was like, “Yeah, but how exactly? And how does
          it work?” So I went to Adriaan and said, “I think Dries has something
          really interesting here. They don’t even need to look into it.” And
          then Adriaan took a technical look at it and got back to me. That was
          interesting.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Bart Sprenkels (00:37):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">Yeah, he has a business.</p>

          Iron Brands (00:37):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          So we approached Dries and said, “Hey, we want to make you an offer.
          The product you’re building is your business.” We already knew Dries a
          bit and knew he was an incredibly good engineer. And then we said, “If
          we can’t do the business side ourselves—and especially I, like I did
          with Simple Analytics—we can do it here too.” And Dries said, “That’s
          fine.” He was open to it, and he even quit his job.

          Iron Brands (00:37):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yes, and then he started working at Simple Analytics as a freelance
          engineer to make ends meet. And, well, we went on to build it.
          Eventually, Simple Analytics scaled down; now he’s there three days a
          week, and it’s gradually moving to full-time, and he has his own
          business. And so do I, because I’m also part of it.

        <p class="mt-0">
          What a nice turn of events. And I really see a similarity between the
          start of Junior Hosted and Simple Analytics—they’re both run by people
          who encounter problems in their own circles or with their own
          activities. I think that’s a great tip for anyone watching or
          listening: if you want to be an entrepreneur, look at your own
          problems. What issues are you facing?
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:38):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Oh, 100%. And especially if you’re somewhat technical and you want to
          be in the SaaS, the software side—yeah, I really like that. Especially
          because I have two partners, Adriaan and Dries, who are, in a way, ten
          times smarter than I am and can really dive deep into a problem and
          build a solution. I didn’t have those skills, so I looked for a
          partner who was complementary to me. But in turn, they couldn’t really
          get things off the ground—Adriaan, maybe semi, but not really—and they
          still needed someone to handle the business or marketing side. You
          need both components. So I would say, if you want that, and you’re
          fairly technical or enjoy working with tech, go look for your own
          problems, because if you have a problem, there’s a good chance others
          face it too.

        <p class="mt-0">
          And if you can share that within a community of people who you know
          also have that problem, you’ll quickly go from zero to one. And if you
          have a more commercial background, you can even start a business
          yourself. But I chose otherwise—I just needed to find those guys who
          can solve those problems and support and help grow their business.
          Because you also need that growth component that they either don’t
          have the desire or the time for.

          Exactly. Out of the eight, five joined, plus three other guys we know
          through connections, all working on their own tech companies and being
          somewhat location independent. I said, “November isn’t the best month
          in the Netherlands. Why not set up somewhere else?” And that’s what we
          did last year. It worked out really well. And now again. But when I
          tell everyone, they think, “Oh, nice, he’s off to Bali on vacation,”
          even though we really worked hard.

          Yes, yes, yes, indeed. I’ve seen what you share on LinkedIn. But just
          because you go there doesn’t mean you ride around on a moped and just
          hang out on the beach.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:41):

          Bart Sprenkels (00:41):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Mopeds are the way to go there, right? I haven’t been there yet.

          Even though we did see the beach, I was actually amazed at how much we
          got done there. That’s because your entire social life is non-existent
          there and your schedule is completely empty. At home, I live with my
          girlfriend and, you know, your cousin comes over for dinner on
          Wednesday and all that. It’s nice—maybe she listens, I really enjoy it
          when you come over, but there are so many things and your weekends get
          completely booked. And then some guys would say, “Yeah, okay. Sure, we
          did fun things on the weekend, but I want to just push forward and
          work undisturbed for a while.” And there were always about three or
          four who said, “Yeah, that’s fine. Me too.” And then four of them
          would go, while others went off to do something else. It was just so
          much easier to set your own schedule than being stuck at home with all
          the social, not a social safety net, but social traps.

        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, I get what you mean, and that really resonated with me too,
          because you mentioned it on the phone. I said at the beginning of the
          episode that when you start a business, it doesn’t have to be in one
          way. You don’t have to have an office, work 40 hours a week in a suit,
          and have clients. There are many ways. And the idea of all of us going
          to Bali because it’s cold here in November really appealed to me.

        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, yeah. And I think that’s one of the great things about
          entrepreneurship—being able to put your own spin on it. And we really
          try to bring that into our product at Simple Analytics. We don’t
          always do things that are super optimized for conversion, but we do
          things that are fun because they give you joy. You can let your own
          creativity flow into your product—a kind of creation from the two of
          us. And you can also make choices based on what you stand for. For
          example, we don’t run ads, and we do that on principle. I know that if
          we did run ads, our revenue could grow much faster. But we actually
          want to set ourselves apart from Google and its ecosystem. So instead,
          we fund our ads ourselves.

          In the end, it could actually yield extra money. And a lot of people
          do that. You might miss opportunities and say, “This is just not how
          we want to build our company or position ourselves.” For example, we
          already share all our numbers. If you go to simpelanalytics.com, you
          can see all our data—though it might need updating.

          revenue and NPS score are up to date there. We actually built that
          dashboard so you can see how much revenue is coming in, what we spend
          on costs, and what our profit is. We did that for several reasons, and
          it’s also a way to add your own creation to your company. We were
          tired of all the bullshit about building companies on social media.
          You know those real estate guys buying houses in Dubai and talking
          about which Rolex you want, and even on professional platforms like
          LinkedIn it’s all just for show—talking about vision, “We’ve raised so
          much funding,” showing a photo of three guys on an Amsterdam bridge in
          white shirts, and then in a year you don’t hear from them because

          It shows how it goes. And you can see in that graph that in the first
          three years you’re just struggling and not much comes in, and then it
          grows steadily. You see that it takes a long time. And if you build a
          software company, these are the costs you have to consider, and you
          get a better picture of how things are going. That’s exactly what we
          wanted to convey—that you don’t have to follow those flashy stories
          about buying real estate in Dubai or raising funding. You can just
          build a company, out of your own pocket, if you work really hard on it
          for five years. It doesn’t all have to come in a month; it grows
          steadily and it’s not like you go from zero to one hundred in a few
          months.

          Plus, we’re now a bit in the privacy space, so transparency is key. We
          believe in transparency. People think it’s awesome that we do
          that—it’s a bit of a marketing/branding thing. So, to get back to the
          point, there are ways to shape your own entrepreneurial story or your
          own company in your own style. This is an example of that—like going
          to Bali. But if people want something else, you can set it up however
          you want.

          Yeah, but I also notice that you’re very active on LinkedIn. I’ve
          mentioned it a few times. Is that intentional? Is it also a form of
          marketing?

          Yeah, LinkedIn is basically marketing anyway—it’s not a platform that
          gives me much satisfaction because I think it’s all feel-good news,
          while it’s actually a lot of bullshit. I’m more on Twitter and,
          recently, Blue Sky—the new Twitter that I’m a big fan of. I do share a
          lot, but I just use a tool that posts on all platforms. So yes, I’m
          very active on LinkedIn, but mostly I share updates like, “We have
          this new building now.” Often when you see people posting on LinkedIn,
          they’re sharing stories about their authority, like “I came across
          this,” and then they DM you and you get my course. We’re basically
          doing continuous updates about what we’re building or that we need
          feedback.

          Yeah, I think so too. And I believe many of my followers are in that
          same boat—they like watching along and giving feedback, just like many

          do you think?” and I get really good responses.

          Yeah, it’s the perfect channel to get feedback. We just launched a new
          part of our onboarding, put it out on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Blue Sky,
          and I got responses like, “I can’t read this” or “It looks weird,”
          etc. Perfect—feedback in, and we build it better. It’s really a way of
          crowdsourcing feedback, and it works perfectly.

          No, no, because there are plenty out there. You know, people say,
          “They’re raising so much funding” and shout from the rooftops. But you
          didn’t raise any funding with Simple Analytics, right? It’s
          bootstrapped, as they say.

        <p class="mt-0">
          Well, bootstrapping means you don’t raise external money. So Simple

          Adriaan, Dries, and my other partners.

          Iron Brands (00:50):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          So yeah. I’m not against funding or investing, but when you see how it
          works in the US versus Europe, all the big companies full of cash come
          from the US, and we use them every day. If you want to think big,
          funding can be a way to build an incredibly large, influential
          company. But it’s not necessary for everything, and it’s becoming the
          norm. In my first company, raising funding was a goal in itself
          because I could put it on LinkedIn and people would look at me and
          say, “Wow, look how big they are working on something; this is serious
          shit.” I feel that funding is trending that way because everyone only
          posts about it when they’ve raised money, even though in many cases
          you might be better off without it.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:51):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          You’re better off not doing it. If you’re building a factory or a
          hardware company and it’s capital intensive, then by all means raise
          as much as you need. But if you’re building a software application or
          an HR dashboard—which, with all due respect, can be a very good
          business—then you might be better off not raising funding. That’s the
          choice we made with Simple Analytics. Our business isn’t capital
          intensive; we set it up ourselves and built it all on our own. And
          while raising funding sounds cool because you get money to invest in
          growth, you also bring someone on board who has a say, and then you
          can’t steer the company exactly how you want.

          Iron Brands (00:52):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          But if it goes wrong, there are many horror stories about things going
          badly with investors and so on. We want to avoid that because we want
          to build our own company in which we make all the decisions ourselves.
          And our product lends itself perfectly to that.

        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          …they’re so low. It’s not capital intensive. So I often think that
          when you have the chance, first see if you can fix it yourself, and
          only raise funding when you really need it—if you need to make capital
          investments or if you’ve found a market and your product works. And if
          I had a hundred thousand or a million, I’d know exactly what to spend
          it on and what would come of it. That’s a kind of growth accelerator,
          but that’s usually later. Most people come up with an idea like an
          Airbnb for cats that they haven’t built yet and then want funding. I’m
          not a fan of that.

        <p class="mt-0">
          I get it. But what’s interesting is that when you started Fix—the
          internship platform—you wanted to become the biggest company, like
          Uber, and that mentality is different from what I hear now at Simple
          Analytics. Now it’s like, “We only need a small market share to do
          what we want.” But wouldn’t it be the case that if you enter such a
          growth phase, you could use funding to grow Simple Analytics a lot
          faster?
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:54):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, that could be. And it’s also a different mindset. A lot of
          people who hear my story say, “You’re thinking too small,” and I often
          get that feedback—and there’s some truth to it. It might still be that
          with Simple Analytics, it’s simply a choice. You could even call it a
          lifestyle business. I already hear that; it sounds crazy when someone
          says that, but it’s become a common term. A lifestyle business means
          you’ve changed your vision, and those rocket companies have to be
          huge, huge, even bigger, the biggest—blasting off—and eventually they
          have to be worth a billion or crash, because it doesn’t matter if it’s
          worth 10 million if you go in the other direction. That’s kind of what
          we do as calm companies: we grow steadily with our own resources and
          design our own lives.

          Iron Brands (00:55):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, and that’s pretty much the route we’re on, though I’m not saying
          it can’t still be huge. You might inject extra money as a growth
          accelerator to get there faster. Those are choices you have to make as
          an entrepreneur. As long as you’re aware of what it means if things go
          wrong or what you’re taking on, it’s fine. So if you’re conscious
          about raising funding, be aware of the risks. And if that’s the
          trade-off—because we want to build the rocket and it has to be worth a
          billion or crash—then fine, go ahead.

        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, and you two have clearly chosen that we don’t have to be a
          rocket, so this is the way to go.

          Iron Brands (00:55):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah. Well, not necessarily—we don’t have to be a rocket, but we
          choose not to raise external funding to build one. That doesn’t mean
          we aren’t still working on growing and having ambitions. We just
          talked about that 1 million per year, and if you do that as a duo with
          low costs, you add it all up and you’re set. Then it works.

        <p class="mt-0">
          And even though we saw the beach, I was actually surprised at how much
          we got done there. That’s because your entire social life is
          non-existent there and your schedule is completely empty. At home, I
          live with my girlfriend and, you know, your cousin comes over for
          dinner on Wednesday and all that. It’s just nice—but there are so many
          things and your weekends get fully booked. Then some guys would say,
          “Yeah, we had fun over the weekend, but I want to just push forward
          and work undisturbed for a while.” And there were always about three
          or four who said, “Yeah, that’s fine. Me too.” And then four of them
          went off while others did something else. It was so much easier to set
          your own schedule than to be stuck at home with all those social
          traps.

        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, I get what you mean, and that really resonated with me too,
          because you mentioned it on the phone. I said at the beginning of the
          episode that when you start a business, it doesn’t have to be one way.
          You don’t have to have an office, work 40 hours a week in a suit, and
          have clients. There are many ways. And the idea of all of us going to
          Bali because it’s cold here in November really appealed to me.

        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, yeah. And I think that’s one of the great things about
          entrepreneurship—being able to put your own spin on it. We really try
          to bring that into our product at Simple Analytics. We don’t always do
          things that are super optimized for conversion, but we do what’s fun
          because it brings you joy. You can let your creativity flow into your
          product—a kind of creation from the two of us. And you can also make
          choices based on what you stand for. For example, we don’t run ads,
          and we stick to that principle. I know that if we ran ads, our revenue
          could grow much faster. But we want to differentiate ourselves from
          Google and its ecosystem, so we fund our ads ourselves.

          In the end, it could actually yield extra money. And many people do
          that. You might miss opportunities and say, “This is not how we want

          They do come through to us, so that’s nice. So keep clicking. But our
          revenue and NPS score are up to date. We built that dashboard so you
          can see how much revenue is coming in, what our costs are, and what
          our profit is. We did that for several reasons, and it’s also a way to
          add your own creation to your company. We were tired of all the
          bullshit about building companies on social media—those real estate
          guys buying houses in Dubai, talking about which Rolex you want—and
          even on LinkedIn it’s all just for show, with talk of vision and
          “We’ve raised so much funding,” showing pictures of three guys on an
          Amsterdam bridge in white shirts, only to vanish in a year because
          they’re off building castles in the sky.

          It shows how it goes. In that graph you see that during the first
          three years, you’re just struggling and not much comes in, and then it
          grows steadily. You see that it takes a long time. And if you build a
          software company, these are the costs you have to consider, and it
          gives you a better picture of how things are progressing. That’s what
          we wanted to convey: you don’t have to follow the flashy stories about
          buying real estate in Dubai or raising funding. You can build a
          company out of your own pocket if you work really hard on it for five
          years. It doesn’t all have to come in a month—it grows steadily, not
          from zero to a hundred in a few months.

          are ways to shape your own entrepreneurial story or company in your

          Yeah, LinkedIn is basically marketing anyway—it’s not a platform that
          gives me much satisfaction because I think it’s all feel-good news,
          while it’s actually a lot of bullshit. I’m more on Twitter and
          recently Blue Sky—the new Twitter that I’m a big fan of. I do share a
          lot, but I use a tool that posts on all platforms. So yes, I’m very
          active on LinkedIn, but mostly I share updates like, “We have this new
          building now.” Often people on LinkedIn post stories about their
          authority, and then they DM you and you get my course. We’re just
          continuously updating what we’re building or asking for feedback.

          No, no, because there are plenty out there. You know, people say,
          “They’re raising so much funding” and shout from the rooftops. But you
          didn’t raise any funding with Simple Analytics, right? It’s

          Well, bootstrapping means you don’t raise external money. So Simple

          Iron Brands (00:50):

        <p class="mt-0">
          So yeah. I’m not against funding or investing, but when you see how it
          works in the US versus Europe, all the big companies full of cash come
          from the US, and we use them every day. If you want to think big,
          funding can be the right way to build an incredibly large, influential
          company. But it’s not necessary for everything, and it’s becoming the
          norm. In my first company, raising funding was a goal in itself
          because I could put it on LinkedIn and people would look at me and
          say, “Wow, look how big they are working on something; this is serious
          shit.” I feel that funding is trending that way because everyone only
          posts about it when they’ve raised money, even though in many cases
          you might be better off without it.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:51):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          You’re better off not doing it. If you’re building a factory or a
          hardware company and it’s capital intensive, then by all means, raise
          as much as you need. But if you’re building a software application or
          an HR dashboard—which, with all due respect, can be a very good
          business—then you might be better off not raising funding. That’s the
          choice we made with Simple Analytics. Our business isn’t capital
          intensive; we set it up ourselves and built it all on our own. And
          while raising funding sounds cool because you get money to invest in
          growth, you also bring someone on board who has a say, and then you
          can’t steer the company exactly how you want.

        <p class="mt-0">
          But if it goes wrong, there are many horror stories about things going
          badly with investors and so on. We want to avoid that because we want
          to build our own company in which we make all the decisions ourselves.
          And our product lends itself perfectly to that.

        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          …they’re so low. It’s not capital intensive. So I often think that
          when you have the chance, first see if you can fix it yourself, and
          only raise funding when you really need it—if you need to make capital
          investments or if you’ve found a market and the product works. And if
          I had a hundred thousand or a million, I’d know exactly what to spend
          it on and what would come of it. That’s a kind of growth accelerator,
          but that’s usually later. Most people come up with ideas like an
          Airbnb for cats that they haven’t built yet and then want funding. I’m
          not really a fan of that.

        <p class="mt-0">
          I get it. But what’s interesting is that when you started Fix—the
          internship platform—you wanted to become the biggest company, like
          Uber, and that mentality is different from what I hear now at Simple
          Analytics. Now it’s like, “We only need a small market share to do
          what we want.” But wouldn’t it be the case that if you enter such a
          growth phase, you could use funding to grow Simple Analytics a lot
          faster?
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (00:54):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, that could be. And it’s also a different mindset. A lot of
          people who hear my story say, “You’re thinking too small,” and I often
          get that feedback—and there’s some truth in it. It might still be that
          with Simple Analytics, it’s simply a choice. You could even call it a
          lifestyle business. I already hear that; it sounds crazy when someone
          says that, but it’s become a common term. A lifestyle business means
          you’ve changed your vision, and those rocket companies have to be
          huge, huge, even bigger—the biggest—blasting off, and eventually they
          have to be worth a billion or crash, because it doesn’t matter if it’s
          worth 10 million if you go in the other direction. That’s kind of what
          we do as calm companies: we grow steadily with our own resources and
          design our own lives.

        <p class="mt-0">
          Yeah, and that’s pretty much the route we’re on, though I’m not saying
          it can’t still be huge. You might inject extra money as a growth
          accelerator to get there faster. Those are choices you have to make as
          an entrepreneur. As long as you’re aware of what it means if things go
          wrong or what you’re taking on, it’s fine. So if you’re conscious
          about raising funding, be aware of the risks. And if that’s the
          trade-off—because we want to build the rocket and it has to be worth a
          billion or crash—then fine, go ahead.

          choose not to raise external funding to build one. That doesn’t mean
          we aren’t still working on growing and having ambitions. We just
          talked about that 1 million per year, and if you do that as a duo with
          low costs, you add it all up and you’re set. Then it works.

          train. It kind of takes over a bit because it's something you see very
          often. And I think many beginner entrepreneurs also think about
          funding, while I believe that it doesn't have to be; just solve a
          problem and build a company around it, and then you can indeed choose
          funding. But it doesn't have to be the number one bullet point on your
          to-do list.

          by jumping on that funding train, I'm actually not so happy with after
          a few years. Because it's all about the funding. Look, if you
          bootstrap, then you can always raise funding when you need it. But
          then you're on a certain trajectory, because your investor will
          eventually want to get their money out.

          It also pushes, like, "Okay boys and girls, let's go!" And I can
          imagine that you make that choice when you start, and you're in your
          company for about four to five years. And then I think, if I could do
          it again, I wouldn't have made that choice. So if you make the choice,
          do it very thoughtfully and assume that you'll have to live with it
          for five years.

          Yes, I believe we already got this tip from Stanley, the football
          photographer. He said if I could do it again, I would be a bit more
          cautious. Also with giving away a percentage of my company, because
          they later said, "I think I could have managed this without giving
          away part of my company," and then I would have been here, but with
          full control to steer my own course, and then he would have
          experienced less stress in that regard.

          Iron Brands (00:59):

        <p class="mt-0">
          Yes, the idea is that I would really like to work with a small team,
          but we want to reach that 1 million with a maximum of about five
          people. That's the goal, and it should be possible because it's a very
          scalable piece of software. And of course, the reason we might want a
          small team is that we want to keep moving fast, which often involves
          developing new things. And now, everything related to tech and product
          falls on Adriaan's shoulders, and everything related to marketing and
          growth falls on mine. So if Adriaan goes on vacation for a month –
          which is totally fine in a bootstrapped software company – it means
          nothing gets developed for a month, so to speak. So we would like to
          move towards a situation that's a bit less founder-dependent.

          Bart Sprenkels (01:00):

        <p class="mt-0">A few freelancers, right? What do they do then?</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (01:00):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yes, so what we have done now – and this is actually a solution that
          works quite well for now – is that we buy in expertise. So there are
          just the two of us, and when you're two, you have to wear all the
          hats. I'm acting as the HR manager and finance for Simple Analytics.
          But, for example, we operate in a market that is very volatile,
          especially in the area of privacy. So we have someone freelance who
          works one day a week on privacy. And that ranges from writing blogs
          about new issues as they arise to ensuring that our own privacy
          documentation is tightly put together. And? Of course, yes. I
          mentioned we have 1300 customers, but we also have major clients from
          really big companies, such as Bloomberg uses us, Mollie uses us, and
          Michelin uses us. Michelin uses us. Now, that brings in quite a bit of
          data. Well, we need to be able to process that properly and store it
          properly.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
          Iron Brands (01:01):
        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Well, then we have Jim. He works on our servers, because Adriaan has
          basic knowledge of servers, but you want that to be set up properly.
          So we need Jim. And Adriaan has basic knowledge of privacy, but if we
          want to set it up properly, we need Carlo, who handles privacy. And so
          we buy in expertise as needed. But we can also quickly drop it if it's
          not necessary. And that way we essentially remain just the two of us,
          but we buy in expertise from time to time. Yes, and I think that as we
          grow, we'll want to move to a model where we have a more in-house
          team.

        <p class="mt-0">
          Yes, that's what you think. And simply because we also enjoy working

          But it also seems like a nice development for the company to work with
          a small team and continue to move quickly, while we are fully
          bootstrapped without external financing.

        </p>
        <p class="mt-0">
          Yes. And do you also have – because now as a founder you really work
          in your company, and then what is often said: instead of working in
          your company, you should work on your company. Because then your
          company isn't dependent on you as a founder, and eventually you could
          sell it. Do you have something like a final goal or an exit or
          something in mind already?

        <p class="mt-0">
          An exit? There's no exit. And that's what I mean. Look, we've told
          each other that if someone comes along and names a really strange
          amount, then we should always consider it. But we do get quite a few
          inquiries from people who either want to buy the company, or from
          private equity, or people who want to invest. And we always put that
          aside a bit because we really enjoy working on this business. And
          because, well, it's not dependent on our hours – we put in a lot of
          hours, but if I take a two‑week vacation, the business still runs. So
          we can easily integrate this business into our lives and ensure that
          the business fits into our life. Yes, so that we can sustain it
          indefinitely. And there's no one outside the two of us who says, "Hey
          guys, I want my money back in seven years," so we're not working
          towards an exit.

          and I don’t rule out that there could be more projects like this,
          where we see opportunities and work with people who are really good at
          solving a problem but find it harder to bring it to market. So that is
          completely open, and it’s really nice that it is, because it doesn’t
          mean that Adriaan and I are obligated to work on it for a minimum
          number of years. No, and I think that maybe one day we’ll reach a
          point where it no longer feels like we really enjoy working on it. Or
          that we can put our passion and creativity into it. And that would, I
          think, be a good moment to consider an exit.

          studied in Maastricht and the Iron Man is held every year in
          Maastricht and it had been a few years already, and then at the pub
          the story went, well, it would be funny if Iron Man did Iron Man,
          because then I would be the first Iron… the one who did Iron Man. And
          then it got a bit out of hand and I thought, fuck it, I’ll just do it.
          And then I came home with that story. And then they thought I was
          joking. And then a few of us said, “Okay, if you do it, then I’ll buy
          your bike.” And then I said, “Okay, that’s fine, I’ll do it.” And
          then, uh, some people caught wind of me doing it and then a cousin of
          mine, who’s an athlete, said, “Well then I’ll train you.” And then I
          worked on it for a year and trained incredibly hard.

          I can totally relate because I’ve done that. And then? After that, I
          never swam, or got on the bike, or ran again. I was completely done
          with it. Just because you spend your whole year on it. That day itself
          is the best day of your life. But the year before is really meh. Yeah,
          but also boring. Because sometimes you’re just in a training session.
          Then you’re just spending 160 kilometers on a bike, just gawking
          around. And yeah, those weren’t the most enjoyable training sessions,
          I must say. Or the best moments. So I thought, “Okay, I’ll do it and
          then I’m completely done.” Yeah. So yeah.

          How awesome that you pulled it off, because I think that’s really
          impressive in one year, yeah. Hats off.

          Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. And, uh, I must say, I could go on about it for
          a long time, because it was six years ago and I haven’t done anything
          since. But yeah, people.
