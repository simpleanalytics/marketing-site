      <p>
        If like me, you feel like Google Analytics 4 turned out to be a dumpster
        fire of jumbled insights, reports that seemingly tell you next to
        nothing, and an overly complex user experience that truly sucks to
        navigate… you're not alone. And this is where Simple Analytics comes in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Simple Analytics is designed around a <em>simple</em> premise—creating a
        simpler way to understand your website's performance without sacrificing
        user privacy. Pretty straightforward, right? Here's a snapshot of our
        Simple Analytics dashboard, where we track the insights &amp; web
        activity on 60+ of our most trafficked web properties Andy &amp; I run:

      <p>
        I recently had the pleasure of interviewing Iron Brands, one of the
        owners of Simple Analytics, and he shared some incredible insights into
        how they've carved out a successful niche in the (<em>extremely</em>)
        competitive web analytics market.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the video interview above, we dive deep into their unique business
        model, their word-of-mouth marketing &amp; growth strategies, and how
        they're using AI to enhance, not replace, human productivity. If you're
        more of the like-to-read-it type, I've got a recap post for ya below.
      </p>

      <h2 id="origin-story">
        The Simple Analytics Origin Story: From Ethical Engineer to
        Privacy-Focused Analytics
      </h2>

      <p>
        The story of Simple Analytics begins with
        <a href="https://www.simpleanalytics.com/press/code-story"
          >Adriaan van Rossum</a
        >, a software engineer who, while working at a development agency, grew
        increasingly frustrated with Google Analytics' approach to user privacy.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          alt="Adriaan van Rossum Simple Analytics Story and Interview"
          src="https://cms.rightblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Adriaan-van-Rassum-Simple-Analytics-Story-Foudner.png"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        Adriaan saw a need for a better solution, one that provided valuable
        insights without compromising ethics. His background as an engineer with
        a strong sense of personal ethics drove him to seek an alternative to
        Google Analytics. He wanted a tool that respected user privacy while
        still providing the essential data website owners needed.
      </p>

      <h3>Hacker News Launch and Early Validation</h3>

      <p>
        Driven by the desire to provide a privacy-focused analytics solution,
        Adriaan built the first version of Simple Analytics and
        <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18070879"
          >launched it on Hacker News</a
        >.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          alt="Hacker News Simple Analytics Launch Screenshot"
          src="https://cms.rightblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hacker-News-Simple-Analytics-Launch-Screenshot-2048x806.jpg"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        The response was immediate and overwhelmingly positive. People were
        actively searching for an alternative that aligned with their values.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Simple Analytics transitioned from a side project into becoming a
        real business, Iron joined the team to handle the marketing &amp;
        operations side of things. He brought his expertise to help grow the
        company and spread the word about their unique approach to web
        analytics.
      </p>

      <h2 id="privacy-matters">
        Why Privacy Matters: Simple Analytics Core Value Proposition
      </h2>

      <p>
        Google Analytics is "free" because they monetize user data, a practice
        that many find concerning. Simple Analytics takes a different approach,
        offering a subscription-based model that ensures user data remains
        private and isn't sold to advertisers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >Their hypothesis is that there's inherent value in paying for a
          service that respects your website visitors.</strong
        >
        A theory that's proven successful, as the company's grown to more than
        1,353+ paying customers.
      </p>

      <h3>The Impact of Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and an Opportunity</h3>

      <p>
        The rollout of Google Analytics 4 (GA4) created mass confusion and
        frustration for millions of website owners, marketers, SEOs, and
        agencies around the world. Its complex interface and overwhelming
        features left many searching for a simpler, more user-friendly
        alternative. This opened a significant opportunity for Simple Analytics.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img

          src="https://cms.rightblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Google-Analytics-4-Reviews-Screenshot-2048x1221.jpg"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        Simple Analytics lives up to its name with its user-friendly dashboard
        and easy-to-understand metrics. You can quickly see where your traffic
        is coming from, which pages are popular, and even set up simple
        conversion funnels.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their analytics experience is designed to provide the essential
        information you need, without the complexity of GA4.
      </p>

      <p>
        This makes Simple Analytics perfect for bloggers, small to medium-sized
        businesses, and anyone who wants a straightforward, privacy-focused
        analytics solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        While larger eCommerce companies heavily reliant on Google Ads might
        still prefer Google Analytics, Simple Analytics caters to those who
        value simplicity and privacy. If you are looking for other options,

      <h2 id="freemium">
        The Shift to Freemium: Offering Free Simple Analytics Accounts
      </h2>

      <p>
        At first, Simple Analytics focused <em>only</em> on a paid subscription
        model. This allowed them to prioritize privacy and avoid selling user
        data. However, competing with a free product like Google Analytics that
        offered a wider range of features was a challenge.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          alt="If it's Free You're the Product Quote"
          src="https://cms.rightblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1542248789727.png"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        To reach a wider audience, Simple Analytics introduced a free plan for
        users with non-monetized websites. This allowed more people to
        experience the simplicity and privacy of Simple Analytics without any
        financial commitment.
      </p>

      <h3 id="word-of-mouth-marketing">
        Free Accounts and a Word-of-Mouth Marketing Boost
      </h3>

      <p>
        The free plan has exploded word-of-mouth marketing results for Simple
        Analytics. Because the product is so good, free users often recommend
        the tool to their employers, friends, or colleagues—leading to new paid
        subscriptions too.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because the company is bootstrapped and focused on sustainable growth,
        they prioritize building meaningful relationships with their users and
        delivering consistent value over time. This long-term focus has been key
        to their success.

      <p>
        Simple Analytics initially focused on SEO, targeting long-tail keywords
        and low-hanging fruit topics where they could create valuable content
        and help people searching for better analytics solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Key Takeaway</strong>: Getting SEO traffic from content
        marketing required significant effort before the advent of AI-powered
        tools like <a href="https://rightblogger.com/">RightBlogger</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="seo-growth-ai">Scaling SEO Traffic with AI Content</h3>

      <p>
        AI tools have enabled Simple Analytics to scale their SEO efforts by
        creating more content and targeting more keywords, <em>faster</em>, by
        using tools like RightBlogger. Here are a couple of their top use cases
        for AI with content:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Blog Posts and How-To Pages</strong>: Iron and his team
          emphasize the importance of human oversight when using AI tools to
          create educational content—and editing to maintain quality &amp;
          authenticity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use Case Landing Pages</strong>: They can now generate
          templated pages for specific use cases, such as adding Simple
          Analytics to different popular website platforms.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All in all, Artificial Intelligence allows Simple Analytics to achieve
        more growth without a large team. Their case study is a fantastic
        example of the potential for entrepreneurs to accomplish more with fewer
        resources.
      </p>

      <h2 id="ai-productivity">
        AI-Powered Productivity: Enhancing (Not Replacing) Human Effort
      </h2>

      <p>
        Like all startup teams I know today, Simple Analytics requires its
        developers to use AI tools
        <a
          href="https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/my-ultimate-toolkit-10-ai-tools-that-boost-productivity-3paj"
          >to enhance their productivity</a
        >. AI can automate repetitive tasks, generate code snippets, and help
        developers work more efficiently in many ways.
      </p>

      <h3>Custom GPT and Tone of Voice</h3>

      <p>
        To ensure consistency in their content, Simple Analytics trained a
        custom GPT model on their own internal knowledge base they've compiled
        &amp; collected over the years.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img

        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        Having their own custom GPT helps maintain a consistent tone of voice
        and brand identity in the AI-generated content they produce.
      </p>

      <p>
        The key takeaway? It's about humans and machines working together in

      <h2 id="mindset">Embracing the Opportunity: An AI Mindset Shift</h2>

      <p>
        Instead of fearing AI, Iron invites everyone to view it simply as a tool
        for enhancing your skills and creating new opportunities. A proactive
        mindset and a willingness to adapt to new technologies have always
        essential for success in business—artificial intelligence is just a new
        evolution in this cycle.
      </p>

      <p>
        AI and other tools have made it easier than ever to start a business or
        create content. Don't let the fear of competition hold you back—take
        action and start building your dream today.
      </p>

      <p>
        Plus, diversifying your income sources is one of the smartest moves you
        can make in today's economy. Having a side project or business to fall
        back on can provide financial security and peace of mind.
      </p>

      <h2 id="takeaways">Final Takeaways on Growing a $500k/yr SaaS</h2>

      <p>
        Adriaan &amp; Iron's story of Simple Analytics is a testament to
        <strong>the power of simplicity, privacy, and taking action</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Simple Analytics found success by offering a user-friendly,
        privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics—and by embracing AI to
        enhance their productivity.
