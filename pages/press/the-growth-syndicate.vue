        You can just start a company, you can just go to the KVK and start a
        company without needing any expertise. So after that I was like,
        alright, I'm going to start a company. And I was like, oh man, this is
        gold. I need to be in. Somehow.

        Ads, not done sending cold emails, not done. Alright. I'm kind of
        limited here. It's kind of a broader move to say we don't do ads. So I
        was in this call, which is massive company, 10 people, people from
        legal, marketing, engineering, just rapid firing all these questions at
        me. Everyone there, I was like, what the fuck am I doing here? My focus
        was just completely off. It's because of how the startup landscape is
        portrayed. Bootstrapping is, I think in the beginning just way harder
        because you are so limited by, you just have time is on your side, but
        you don't have any money. Every day is a reality check.

        What do you think is the most important ingredients for a marketer or

        Co-founder or solo founder. Co-founder. Alright. So if you go on your
        LinkedIn, you can see that you're actually quite public about what's the
        current a RR of your companies and when that's going to happen. And then
        we're going to see how far off you are when you actually reach the goal.

      <p class="mt-0">
        Okay. Alright. We have our second ever guest, Iran Brands. Welcome.
        Thank you for joining us. Yeah, thanks for having me guys. Really
        excited. So let's talk about your background. Iran, you are the
        co-founder of Simple Analytics. I would describe you as a serial
        entrepreneur. You've founded several bootstrap companies and yeah,
        simple Analytics being probably the one that people are most familiar
        with. At this stage, you're on a mission to bootstrap simple analytics
        to 1 million a RR. Currently at around 380 5K, if I'm not mistaken. This
        is with two people.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (01:54):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">Yeah, I would say two and a half, but it's like two</p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Ferdinand Goetzen (01:58):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        And some help. Very cool. Yeah, of course you have a team around you
        guys, but it's you and your co-founder driving this bus, right? Yeah,
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (02:06):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Yeah, no definitely. And I wouldn't say, to be fair, I'm not really the
        co-founders because Ian started it himself, which was about five years
        ago and I only joined I think what it's now two and a half years ago. So
        what do you call that? A late co-founder
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Ferdinand Goetzen (02:23):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Still works. Still works. Still works. I would say once you hit that
        product market fit, and if you're there through the early days, the
        longer the journey goes, the less of a question that becomes. You've
        also founded another company, which is, sorry, UNI hosted where you guys
        host Unify controllers in the cloud. I'll be honest, I don't know what
        that means.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (02:44):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        I don't know. Before I started have no idea what you've to tell us more.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Ferdinand Goetzen (02:48):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        We'll get to that. Cool, awesome. Look, let's just start where we always
        start, which is what is your origin story? Where did you start and how
        did you get to what you're doing here?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (02:57):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Alright, yeah, so I actually started being an entrepreneur, I think it
        was five years ago. I was in uni in Matech. So I'm from Mastery, studied
        the mastery and then at one point I was studying doing master's in
        finance and everyone went into consultancies or whatever and I thought,
        okay, maybe, okay, let's go with the flow. And I worked, I did an
        internship at a consultancy and I was like, man, this is not it. They
        can't be it. It's so boring. I was a nice company, nice people
        whatsoever, but I was like, nah, this can't be it. And then I did an
        internship at a startup, which kind of failed big time, but I learned so
        much. But the thing I took with me was like, you can just start a
        company. You can just go to Kaka and start a company without need any
        expertise.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (03:49):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        So after that I was like, alright, I'm going to start a company, I've no
        idea, but I want to start a company. So I met up with one of my mates
        from university and we were like, okay, what should we start? We were
        both not engineers, so we couldn't build anything. So we're like, we're
        still kind of students. We were like, ah, maybe we can make a
        marketplace for students, connect them with internships at companies and
        then that's going to be the next Uber. So easy as that. But then five
        years ago we didn't know nothing. We were complete idiots and the
        easiest idea we could think of, but we just went for it. And the
        company's called Fix is actually still alive, Neil, so my co-founder is
        still running it, but that was, I think, so that was probably started at
        maybe four or five years ago. And then actually I think we've come full
        circle now because when I was with Neils we were like, we're just super
        into how do we grow this thing? We couldn't build, we focused on growth.
        So do you you read business books but also podcasts And one podcast we
        listened, obviously it's a Sean Alice podcast and you were on, you were
        at the printing company.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Ferdinand Goetzen (05:08):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">Yeah, 3D hubs.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (05:09):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I was listening with Neil, I remember we were
        saying we should do what this guy is doing. He was doing AB testing and
        that kind of, but we had 10 users,
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Ferdinand Goetzen (05:22):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        We had a bit more budget I think at that time, different
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (05:24):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Stage. But that's nice to be listened to your podcast and I'll be on
        your podcast. But then we somehow made it work. So there was nothing
        like validation, product market fit, we just kept on just going at it
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Ferdinand Goetzen (05:40):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">Grinding,</p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (05:41):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Just trying and just added maybe 2000 sales calls and just pitching the
        thing and companies were like, yeah, I don't really have this problem.
        But eventually I think we kind of scaled until 120 KARR with margins
        like 60%. So that's all right for one person but not for two. And just,
        this took a very long time. So at one point I was like, okay, maybe this
        is not it anymore. Or you are actually at the position where it's too
        big to actually shut down, but also it's not going to scale. So you
        have, it's not the golden, the bronze handcuffs or something, you dunno
        which side you're going to go and you get kind of stuck. So at one point
        then I moved to Amsterdam and the major issue I had with fix is that we
        couldn't build anything. So I was like maybe I should learn how to code.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (06:44):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        I didn't like coding, but I thought maybe that's needed. So I did a no
        code course and then there was this other guy who was also in the no
        code course. We met up and that was super nice. I was new in Amsterdam
        and I was like, hey, maybe we can try and get a meetup of other people
        in the hackers who I was kind going into that direction. There's people
        building products themselves and bootstrapping maybe can do a meetup.
        And he knew a bunch of people and one of them was Ian. So we did a
        meetup. I had a conversation with Arian and he basically told me, or I
        said, well whatcha are you doing? And he said, oh, I'm building this
        analytics tool. And I said, alright cool and is it making any money? And
        he's like, yeah, I'm doing 10 KA month.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (07:26):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        And I was like, alright, that's impressive one person company. So how do
        your clients find you? And he said, well, I have no idea do. And I was
        like, oh man, this guy is going to be, this is gold. I need to be in
        somehow. And that was at the stage where I was letting go fix a little
        bit more, but it's still took six months before we actually met up
        again. I was like, Hey man, I'm actually ready to start thinking about
        something else. Do you need a partner? And he was like, yeah, I can
        remember a conversation and maybe this will work. And then we did
        because he was alone, I was like, okay, we need to figure out whether we
        actually match because that's the number one thing companies get
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Ferdinand Goetzen (08:12):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">Because you guys didn't know each other at</p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (08:14):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">This point really.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (08:15):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        We had no idea. We just had one conversation and then through the phone
        because I called them and say, Hey, you're looking for a partner, so
        that's it. So we met up and I was like, okay, how can we make this kind
        of work but also go out of each other's ways if it doesn't work? And
        just easy because you didn't want to get caught up in legal and all that
        bullshit. So I told him, okay, I'll start just doing some work for you.
        Because I was also just looking for new projects to take on and that was
        fine. And at one point he said, okay, I told him if you want to do this
        real partnership long time, then I want a piece of the pie. I'm an
        entrepreneur and if you're willing to give that up, we should start
        thinking how we want to do it.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (09:04):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        But if you're not and you just want me as a freelancer, then it's not
        going to work for me. So that was a question and he was like, yeah,
        actually I want to give up a big piece of the pipe. It helps me scale
        from 10 to whatever because that's got to be 70 or 60 or 80% of Arian.
        Andon is going to be worth more than hundred percent of if you stick by.
        So I was like, okay then let's do it like this. I'll just work for you
        for three months, one, two days in the week and it's just completely
        free. And at any moment you can just cut it up if you don't want to. But
        after three months we feel like, hey, there's something here. This is
        going to be a good team, then I'll need a big piece of the pie. And then
        we actually after three months, even after one month, we were like, oh
        fuck, this is going to work. So yeah, that's how we got
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Ferdinand Goetzen (09:59):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Started. Cool story. Crazy how I had the, well very different, but with
        my previous company also my co-founder, we met on two phone calls and
        said, let's just start a company. So it's funny how you have some
        companies where founders go back to, oh we were roommates in college and
        some you just meet and it just works. What stands out to me is trust is
        such an important part there because you basically said, I'll work for
        you for free for a while. So you were willing to show that you're
        interested, your engaged
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (10:32):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Risk. He put in a lot of risk by thinking about me because he was doing
        and already build a company. I didn't have to do the hard part. The hard
        part is starting it and actually getting traffic and customers. So I was
        like, alright, lemme put in some risk here as well. That's
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Clement Dumont (10:49):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Nice. You guys are meeting halfway. Actually that was pretty cool.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (10:52):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        I remember the point, this is always a very delicate thing, right?
        Working with co-founders and equity sharing and how you're going to do
        it. And a lot of founders get into arguments because the one is putting
        more work or whatever. And even if you go into decent negotiations, it's
        actually the worst thing is actually getting the best deal because we
        need to make sure that both of you have the best deal. Normally in
        negotiations you're trained to or whatever you want to get the best deal
        or whatever. But we were like, okay,
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Together (11:30):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">Are you happy? You both need to be happy.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (11:31):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Are you happy with this? Yes. Or you want to be more? No. Okay, we're
        happy you happy you happy? And then we were like, alright, we're both
        happy, let's continue. And that's the last time we ever talked about
        this stuff because from there on was just focus on the business.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Ferdinand Goetzen (11:46):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Yeah, that's great. So let's go practical. You meet this guy, you like
        what he's doing, you see that he's sitting on something natural
        traction, which usually is a sign of good product market fit, which is
        what a lot of companies, it's the opposite. They somehow artificially
        boost the traction, but there is no real product market fit underneath.
        So there's something there. You work together on some kind of loose
        basis for a while. You come in as a partner, what's the first thing you
        do?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (12:14):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">Try to learn what the tool is all about. I mean ...</p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Ferdinand Goetzen (12:18):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Assuming you've done that in the three months where you were kind of
        collaborating.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (12:22):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        So I was actually trying to understand the users. What types of users do
        you have? How are people actually coming in? Because obviously there's
        some ways that people actually find you and just try to create a whole
        picture of what's going on right now. And from there you can actually
        start testing new channels and see what works, what doesn't work. Man,
        I've got loads of going on there. But yeah, so in the past two and a
        half year we basically tested everything and see what work. He's just
        pushing buttons and then pushed the one that's working when you push the
        hardest. And to be honest, he liked working with me because he thought I
        was a good marketer and I think probably doing well, but I'm not just
        like, what do you guys call it? I think you called it the t-shaped
        marketer doing the technically, man, I don't know any AB testing or
        Python, it was way more bare bones. It was also we didn't have any
        funding. It was just like, alright, just figure it out, see what works.
        And then yeah, but I think,
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Clement Dumont (13:31):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Yeah, sorry. No, I was just curious. So when you joined, what was
        actually bringing those customers at the beginning? So what was the
        journey like there?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (13:41):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        So I think Arian got most of the first customers through Hacker News,
        which was the crowd which was on there. It's like the developers anti
        Google, whatever, because simple analytics is a Google analytics
        alternative basically. So we make it more simple privacy friendly
        because Ian thought, hey, this is just this Google analytics, this is
        monstrosity, it's complex, not everyone needs it. So as an engineer that
        is annoyed. Annoyed engineers build in their own stuff. Then you
        launched on Hacker News and then boom, people were like, holy shit, this
        is what I want. So he got on the front page of Hacker News I think
        multiple times. So that's where I think the first a hundred users came
        from and people actually loved the product and they just told other
        people. And that's how

        Yeah, good product market fit. Yeah, definitely. That's great then. So
        it's interesting because you talked about, oh I'm not a T-shaped player
        and I don't do all this technical sales, but honestly, no matter how
        skilled or experienced you are, the first thing you should do when you
        enter any kind of growth marketing project initiative company, whatever
        team is figure out who the hell is buying this thing, who are we selling
        to? And it's funny that you'll have people who are amazing at AB testing
        and they'll jump into that before even thinking about who's the
        customer. So it occurs to me at least when I see your post, when I see
        you talking that you guys have a really strong idea of what kind of
        company buys simple analytics. Is that something that you kind of went
        in thinking this is really important or is it more you're bootstrapping,
        you need to try stuff and you keep iterating your way until you get to
        that definition?

        I think it's a bit of both because obviously as a bootstrap company
        you're kind of limited. And then my co-founder is a privacy minded guy.
        So he is like, alright you only before you start ads not done sending
        cold emails, not done. Alright, I'm kind limited here. Obviously I kind
        of like it as well. It's kind of a baller move to say we don't do ads
        because we are, we're not fighting Google, it's like we're not taking
        any market share of them, but it's like for us it feels that way and we
        don't want to, with the money we get from our users, actually give it
        back to Google, give it back to Google and then reinforce that their
        ecosystem even it's like a drop on the plate but it's doesn't feel right
        for us to do that. So we don't do any ads. And also sending cold emails
        spread of a privacy issue there as well.

        So I was like, okay, that's not off, that's not what we do, so we need
        to figure out something else. So you kind of limited in that sense
        because you don't have budget, it's just me and it's just so what is the
        something else? Yeah, that's a good one. So we tried lots of stuff and
        also a lot of fuckups and I'll do the fuckup first, which was at my
        previous company at Fix, everyone came through sales. So just doing
        outreach and get on a call with a customer and make them convert to
        actually become a customer. So I was like, alright, I kind of figured
        that out in my previous company so I'll probably figure it out here. But

        sure, I'll put mine on your platform as well and if we get the right
        student through there, I'll pay you fine. But not everyone is everyday
        looking for a different analytics solution, so you would never get them
        on the right spot. And then also your product needs to fit with the
        channel. I think there was this guy, I think it's Brian Belfor, he has
        this framework which is like four check boxes and one of them is I think
        channel product fit, which basically means if you're selling enterprise
        software, you're not going to rely on TikTok, whatever. Yeah, exactly. I
        was just thinking, so simple analytics, if you want to start goes nine
        euros, you want to do sales calls for nine euros, that's probably not
        the best solution. So in this, but I didn't think about that.

        So I was in this call, which is massive company. It was I think a
        company that built healthcare equipment for hospitals and so it's a
        massive company, but there's not a big website who goes to the website
        like salespeople or something. But they were in the call with me with 10
        people, people from legal, marketing, engineering, just rapid firing all
        these questions at me about the analytics tool. And then the main guy,
        he basically said, alright, pricing, what are we talking about? So I was
        like, okay, our pricing is based on page views, so if you have a big
        website, you pay more. Then for example, if you have a small website, so
        what is the amount of page shoes that you have? And it was like, yeah,
        on average it's like 80,000 page shoes a month. I was like, alright, so
        yeah, that will be nine euros a month then. And then you saw everyone
        there was like, what the fuck am I doing? And even one of the developers
        basically said, yo dude, if you want to have this tool, just use it. And
        then you just logged out and it just went away. And then the guy was
        also looking at me, he's like, mate, if you just said 500 a month, that
        would be a sign off. You said nine. So I was like, ah, you

        Basically big time. Big time. So from now on if anyone wants to call it
        starts at 500. So that didn't really work, but I'm probably maybe not
        also the best guy on sales. So if you're very good at sales, you can
        always hit me up and maybe try it. So what did work was SEO, I believe
        there's two phases in growth. So the one phase which is actually going
        from zero to one, let's say you start a company and you want some get
        traction, I think you don't need to think about all these long-term
        strategies. It's just get out there and find customers to talk to, send
        LinkedIn messages, be very scrappy, launch on product and interact on
        forums, hustle, just hustle to get the first customers into the door. So
        Ian already kind of did that and he went to from zero to one.

      <p class="mt-0">
        That's from zero to 10 km. So after that then there was time, okay,
        maybe this is already working, so maybe we just think about sustainable
        ways to grow the business that you can actually continue and scale. So
        SEO was one of them that worked out pretty well. So I focus a lot on
        that. And actually it's interesting now we only start thinking about
        doing more product-led growth, which was actually one of the first
        things that actually worked in very small because it's basically word of
        mouth that worked. But now we are thinking, okay, how can we actually
        make the flywheel fly bigger? And so we debated a lot, but we are
        actually going to add a free plan, which is we're five years in now and
        we are now going to add a free plan. That's also the thing about being
        bootstrap is adding a free plan.

        It's like a risky move because we need money to survive. If it was fe, I
        don't care about money, I want users and just figure out the money
        later. But I was like, if we had a free plan, he'd be people that are
        actually paying, just move back to the free plan. So then we needed to
        figure out really who our users are. We needed go really who is buying
        this and who might be switching back? And then we found something
        interesting, which was we have multiple groups now. So we started off
        with this, the developer on Hacker News that started using it. But since
        we've grown a bit bigger also businesses start using it and we found out
        that most of the revenue actually is driven by businesses. Well, okay,
        that's not like we figured that out. So the businesses are actually
        driving the revenue, but still the developers are the most focal about
        this. So the

        Yeah, so the ones that actually love the product the most are not
        bringing in the most revenue and businesses, they just swipe the cart,
        use it kind of like, but they don't tell other businesses. It's the
        developers that actually start just spreading out the word. So we were
        like, okay, can we get more of those developers in? Because the
        developer with a side project that uses simple analytics base nine euros
        a month, it's a drop on a plate. But he also has a job, he works in the
        company. And when they discuss, Hey, should we switch to another
        analytics tool? This developer say, Hey, I'm using simple analytics on
        the side project. Maybe start looking into that. It's

        Exactly. And this is actually how a lot of companies came into the door
        because they had a developer, a marketeer working that said, Hey, I'm
        using this from a personal side that it's nice and cool and maybe this
        is something we want to use. And then it's like the Trojan horse
        basically. So we were like, okay, if we would strip away the money we
        get from the small developers or whatever, we could probably 10 x at a
        moment because it wouldn't be free. And then a lot of people like these
        types of clients where I don't actually want the money from they come
        in, use it for free. Most of them still work at a company, they just put
        it on a side project or a block or whatever because they don't need
        complex Google analytics on a side project that has hundred visitors
        every month. So they will just use simple analytics. That's the
        assumption obviously. And then they work at a company and when the
        company is discussing, hey, we should use different analytics tool, they
        just vouch for us.

        So even if you have a project or a business you want to use analytics

        just free. For us, we start until I think next week when we launch a
        free plan, we are charging at least nine euros a month. And if you don't
        make any money then you'll keep just using GA four. That's for the
        people that are, I would say just the developers in the hackers and
        people that have a blog. And for companies it's obviously Google
        Analytics the most well-known thing. It's just the default. You just go
        there and you dunno a lot about other alternatives. That's my job to
        actually get the awareness. Yeah, create some awareness. And then again,
        also a lot of companies just rely on it because we are privacy friendly
        and simple. So we're built for simple analytics and also for people that
        actually care about privacy and compliance. But there's also a lot of
        companies like rely on ads and Google GA four, even if it's sucks, it's
        just the most powerful and complex analytics tool out there that gets a
        lot of companies, a lot of revenue and we can only do 10% of what
        insights they can provide you. So if you really need that, you still
        need to go through it and use it.

        wrong. You could go either way with just what fits with your company.
        For example, by the way, I'll phrase it like this. I think the problem
        here is actually the media and tech crunch because that's how I got
        tricked in wanting to have VC funding in my first company. So when we
        started Fix, you go on LinkedIn, you read the Lean Startup, you read all
        the Sprout, the media, and there's all these articles. Oh, they got so
        much funding, they got so much funding and you see three guys on the
        bridge, on the bridge in Amsterdam. And I was like, I need to be that
        guy. I want funding now because that's apparently how it's supposed to

        when I was at FIX with my partner Neils, we were like, oh man, we need
        funding. That's it. Customers we don't care. Revenue we don't care. It's
        funding, funding, funding. And now I'm thinking, man, I was an idiot.
        What was I thinking? But it is because when you start out, you just
        follow what the masses are saying or at least what's getting portrayed
        in the tech media because it inspires you. You read it and you want to
        be like it. I wanted to be an interesting person and I knew if I got
        funding, people would think, oh man, they're building a great company.
        And my parents would think, oh, he got funding. Oh, amazing. And before
        Bootstrap I was like, he's doing a little project on the side. So I was
        just so focused on getting funding and we didn't get it because the
        business model was not good enough or whatever, but my focus was just
        completely off and it's because of how the startup landscape is
        portrayed. So that was bootstrap basically while I wanted to have
        funding, which didn't get it. So we needed to figure it out. And I think
        with simple analytics, that was a very conscious decision maybe because
        he was just this engineer, hacker news, anti anti funding.

        Yeah, I mean I generally think you can probably, unless if you're
        building SaaS, let's be honest, you don't need a warehouse of supply,
        whatever, I think you could probably make an argument against funding
        for most software companies, but especially in the early days, your
        interests don't align with the interests of a vc. vc. The whole idea
        behind a VC is I invest in 10 companies and one of them is going to do
        great and the two couple are going to do okay and the others doesn't
        really matter. That doesn't fit with what you need. Especially right in
        the early days, so companies are now gravitating towards this, but I
        think some people also have a little bit of this grass is always
        greener. Like oh, funding, you've got VCs breathing down your deck,
        you've got a raise, you're not profitable, you lose control over your
        company and all those things. You can absolutely be true. They don't
        have to be, but they can. And I would say probably in most cases they do
        end up being true to some degree. What are some of the challenges of
        bootstrapping that you think people either aren't aware of or maybe are
        aware of but underestimate?

        you're saying is I heard a lot of people actually that did the VC route
        and then sold the company or bankrupt. I'm never doing that again. I've
        never heard someone that's bootstrap say that next time I want to do vc.
        No, everyone is bootstrap and it works out. You can just have a business
        on your own terms. For example, we don't have an exit strategy. We can
        do this forever. We do do what we want to do. We wanted to have freedom.

      <p class="mt-0">
        The first thing you do is actually get someone in with money. You're
        still working for someone still not in a traditional way obviously, but
        you still need to be accountable for whatever you do. So yeah, those are
        the things. If it works out, it's just so nice being bootstrap. You have
        a lot of optionality. We don't need funding, but I'm not against
        funding. So if there's a very strategic play here, we even might think
        about it, but we have the options. I have all the cards and the VC or
        whatever, I don't need you. But when you're running out of cash and you
        build a business with that burns a lot, you'll need the VC and you'll
        need the follow up round or whatever. You'll need an extra strategy. You
        need to have an investments slide pitch deck like bullshit pig deck with
        tam. Ridiculous numbers always.

      <p class="mt-0">
        Okay, but that's enough about faeces. So bootstrapping is I think in the
        beginning just way harder because you are so limited by, you just have
        time is on your side, but you don't have any money. So how long can you
        do it? How many savings do you have the first time when my first company
        at fix, I lived with my parents and I didn't earn a single dollar or
        euro for a year, so I was earning zero a month for a whole year. I lived
        with my parents, which is luxury, so just okay, that made it work, lived
        on a bit of savings. Next year I earned 1500 a month for a whole year,
        which was also, and then I moved toda, which is expensive as you all
        know. Third year I was earning 2000 a month because we weren't growing
        properly. So I was like, man, you're getting in a lot of shit because
        you need to pay your bills and when you have funding, it makes it easy.
        You have a bit longer runway, but also you're in the pressure cooker,
        which is also sometimes a good thing because then it needed to happen or
        you just,
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Ferdinand Goetzen (34:23):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Well, I think one thing that occurs to me is that when you're working in
        a bootstrapped environment as a founder or a marketer or a marketing
        team, you're forced to face hard truth earlier because when you have
        money you can say, oh, maybe this campaign or this channel or this
        thing. Whereas when you don't have money and you need to do a lot with
        very little, you need to have the right kind of product market fit. You
        need to be selling to the right people. And those are some of the basics
        that are, we talk to companies that say, oh, well we do 200 K and this
        year we need to do 50 million. And you're like, even if that is
        possible, you're not going to micro optimise your way from 200 K to 10
        million. It's big leaps and the kind of things we see make the
        difference is you do something in the product or something in the
        positioning or something in the ICP that substantially changes the base
        economics of your company, the feasibility of your commercial motion. So
        you unlock an ICP that can spend way more money, you pivot from B2C to B
        b2b. It's like these big things are the only things actually move
        companies in massive shifts. When you're bootstrapped, you don't need
        the same massive shifts. Like you say, you have time on your side if you
        can sustain yourself, but you do have to face those realities sooner
        because you can't actually delay them because every month you don't earn
        money is a month closer to running out of cash and not being able to do
        it.

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (35:49):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        No. Yeah, a hundred percent. It is just like every day is a reality
        check. You can't behind like, Hey, I have a nice salary because the VC
        is paying me. It's just like you get in touch with reality very quickly
        when you don't have money. So yeah, that makes sense. Well, I think
        there's for both ways there's something to say obviously if you're
        building whatever hardware stuff, obviously, but if you specifically
        would be looking at sasa, which is just try to stay bootstrap as long as
        possible because you can always take funding if you need it, if you see
        a strategic play which gets you 10 x customers, whatever, but you have
        the optionality to either do that or go your own way because once you
        get funding and even before product markets fit, you're like, all right,
        you're going to fees zero and you need to figure it out or you'll die.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Ferdinand Goetzen (36:42):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Yeah, funnily, what I see happen with a lot of companies is when they
        raise money before product market fit, and if they don't manage to
        figure out some of these core elements we just talked about before, the
        money starts to run out, they start going into almost thinking like a
        bootstrap company because they're running out of cash and they need to
        extend their runway three to six months to get that next round. And
        those three to six months is usually when the magic happens. That's when
        almost every company that's a unicorn pivoted once, twice, or three
        times from the original proposition. And they always happen during that
        crunch time. When you start running out of cash and you start having to
        reconsider the core principles of how you're going to grow, then the
        magic happens. And I guess bootstrap companies, they just do that from
        day one. So I think you don't see all the bootstrap companies that are
        doing 10, 15, 20 KMRR have product market fit

      <p class="mt-0">
        But wait, one question. What do you think? Because I have an opinion,
        but I never did VC route. You did as well, you did both and you're
        bootstrapping now. You did a VC route, you experienced both worlds.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Ferdinand Goetzen (37:52):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Yeah, I have both raised VC money and Bootstrap, and I've also worked
        for companies like Recruitee was bootstrapped 3D House with VC funded
        and consulted and engaged with lots of companies, all shapes and forms.
        Personally, I agree, bootstrap as long as you can. I think there are
        some great VCs out there who really care about the founders, care about
        the mission and really engage. There are a lot of crappy VCs and the
        majority are, and there's this very fake culture of when they need
        something from you or they think you could be interesting, they'll
        answer every email, they make, every effort, and then when maybe it's
        not going that hot or you're figuring things out, they don't answer your
        calls. They take calls while they're on the train. And then every other
        VC you talk to about, oh, that's not professional. But there are a lot
        of questionable VCs out there. But I think fundamentally it's all about
        leverage. Everything's about leverage in the sense, and if you could
        always say, I don't need the funding, I can go by myself, you'll always
        be in the strongest position. And I agree. If you see a strategic reason
        for raising, that's a whole other story
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (38:56):</p>

        Ferdinand Goetzen (38:58):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        But I just personally believe that with SaaS it rarely happens that
        you'll have that big strategic good example is with 3D hubs, at one
        point we had this distributed network of manufacturers, and one of the
        big questions is, how do you maintain quality when there's factories
        across the world? How do you maintain quality? Well, you have to
        implement this thing called cross docking. What that means is that
        instead of sending the manufactured parts to the client, you send them
        to a cross dock centre, one in Chicago, one in Amsterdam, where arts
        arrive, you inspect them and then you send them on. So you kind of try
        to balance what would happen in a normal factory, which is proper
        quality control with this distributed network that's not cheap to set
        up. That's like a totally reasonable reason to raise funding is to say,
        we have to build this supply chain operational thing, but with software,
        what are you going to do?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (39:49):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Oh, we're going to eat up the market share. But these companies, they
        come and go so quickly that I don't even know how much that really
        matters. So yeah, I've gone kind of full circle on this. I think with my
        previous company, we raised too early and I think we would've benefited
        a lot from spending the first 12 months struggling in a bootstrap
        environment because we started figuring things out relatively late. In
        the end, it worked out. But I think being in that high stakes
        environment, figuring things out, I think that actually gets you to the
        best, makes you learn the things you need to learn in order to be
        successful.

      <p class="mt-0">
        It kind of makes sense, but isn't then that faeces have this, what is
        it? They also have kind an image problem, right? Because that was also
        the thing that was in the back of my mind is just a horror stories
        people have. And I've never dealt with any VCs, so I can't really judge
        whether it's true, but it's like, man, stay away from a company
        basically, even if I don't know you, but it's like a bad vibe around it

      <p class="mt-0">
        Obviously, obviously. No, I think most of them are perfectly fine, but
        it's the thing that if there's a shit VC out there that just treat
        founders not well, it reflects on the whole VC environment.

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Ferdinand Goetzen (41:10):

      <p class="mt-0">
        Well, yeah, and I guess it's not black and white, that sense. There are
        definitely VCs that are really great people, really supportive, and
        there are really terrible VCs. There are great companies and terrible
        companies. But that being said, it is also that model a little bit that
        if you've invested in 20 companies and you have three champions that are
        doing really well and then you have one or two that are not doing as
        well, you don't really always the same attention into those one or two.
        And the thing that you see roughly is when you ask people, how's your
        vc? If your company's doing well, the feedback's usually pretty good.
        Oh, they connect us with great talent and they brought us the money and
        that's great. And when they're not doing so well, they're like, fucking
        hate my VCs. That's how it is, right? Money is the underlying, every VC
        is always like, oh, we bring you access to this and that.

      <p class="mt-0">
        It's about the money. At the end of the day, if you didn't bring the
        money to the table, nobody cares about your network. Nobody cares about
        maybe with very few exceptions, it's really about putting the money on
        the table and helping your business case. But yeah, I want to bring it
        back to the practicality because we do also have a lot of marketers who
        listen and they're going to be like, okay, cool VC bootstrap. I can't
        change that. In an environment, let's say a bootstrap environment or one
        where you are working with very little money, you've touched upon this
        already with some of the things that you guys do, what do you think is
        the most important ingredients for a marketer or marketing team to be
        successful? When budget is limited,
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (42:36):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        You need to be creative. So that's one thing I'm kind of proud of that
        we figured that out is like, okay, so that was actually at the beginning
        when I joined. It was just me and Arianne. You say, okay, we have zero
        monies. Okay, we want to work with SEO. Okay, that's going to take a
        while, but we should invest in it. And then at one point it's like,
        okay, can we not think of other things on how to get more of what we
        already have? So we knew the first customers, they came from a specific
        spot where it was Hacker News. So we were like, okay, can we not get
        more from Hacker News? Because that seems to be the only channel which
        is actually tested and working, but Hacker News is notoriously difficult
        to get on the first page, and if you get any promotion, you'll just be
        stabbed to death on the internet.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (43:29):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        So what we did is actually we created some stuff, which we called How to
        Hack Hacker News. And well, we actually, if you type this in Google, I
        wrote a blog about it, so it's probably one of the first hits, and you
        can read what we did, but we started to see if there's any news in the
        tech space, we'll probably get to the first page of Hacker News. And a
        lot of people actually go to the article, read it or comment or
        whatever. So we were like, okay. At that point, I think it was two and a
        half years ago, those Google analytics had some privacy issues,
        especially with the GDPR and the EU government. And nobody was like,
        okay, can we use it? Is it banned or whatever. So what we did, we
        figured out if there's some news on Google which is relevant to the
        community, we just have to write about it as the first ones and put it
        on Hacker News so people actually think, actually read a news article.
        It's written by us, but it should be obviously very good quality. So
        what we did is built a little alert system, so when there's anything on
        Google in the news, we would just get a ping on Telegram and we would
        pens down, this is it. Let's go. We're going to work on this. And we
        call it a war room, which is a bit silly, but alright.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (44:57):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        What I did was, for example, those thing, Austria, I was thinking of
        banning Google Analytics because of privacy reasons and not Austria, but
        the data privacy agency in Austria. So we were like, the moment when it
        hit, it came into our telegram, we read it and then I wrote this whole
        thing, which basically replicates the news, but with all more okay
        implications, this is actually what it means and this is what you can do
        and just no marketing, because if you one banner or whatever, and you're
        just done. So only at the last sentence we put like, alright, if you
        just hate Google Analytics, just give simple analytics a spin. And
        because it was just so informative and so timely and we were always the
        first actually cover it before TechCrunch or before whatever, we just
        spin it out on Hacker News. And I think we did maybe 15 of those 15 and
        probably eight or nine came on the homepage on Hacker News, but we also
        put it in Reddit, so Reddits and all that stuff. So lots of traffic in
        the doors. So we were still focusing on building thinking, long-term,
        building scalable growth stuff like SEO, tweak your product led growth,
        improve your onboarding pricing whatsoever. But we still stayed scrappy
        and creative and just try to get more users into the door. And I think
        if you get really a good balance of that in the first phases until SEO
        kicks in, then you're golden.

        then, actually there's a bit of pressure off because you can pay your
        bills, so then you can actually focus a bit more on long-term. So the
        focus was actually long-term, but when these articles hit, we were just
        like, alright, now time for short term basically that it felt very
        natural to go in that kind of state or something.

        Just you create value for people and then they go, Hey, these people
        create value and they're interesting and they believe in things I
        believe in. So I'm going to check out what else they do. Which brings me
        to the thing, you haven't mentioned it, but I've seen it. You guys are
        also building a brand building in public.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (49:07):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        I had love to know more about the decision to do that because it's easy
        on the one hand, on the other hand, trying to sell to people and then
        putting everything public that, so that's a decision. And you guys are
        building a good story. You guys have a really good story. And the more
        people get fed up with GA four or the standard solutions out there, and
        the more familiar they become with you guys, your brand, your story, the
        more it's going to click. So how do you guys think about the brand
        you're building and what went into that decision to build in public?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (49:41):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        So when I joined, AIAN was already building in public, but for us it
        made sense on the one hand, because we're privacy friendly company, and
        so we want to be transparent because that's the brand what we are trying
        to build. So we want to be transparent, show people what we're doing,
        show people under the hood basically, and show them, okay, this is how
        we're building a company. We're also not making use of any ads where
        this is our NPS score, this is how many data points, and also metrics.
        So how much we are earning, and not just the revenue, but also profit
        margins and profit, because that's always the thing that comes to my
        second point. I think we should talk a bit more, or in general, we
        should talk a bit more real about money because or building a business,
        you see so many guys on YouTube, for example, Hey, want to earn 10 KA
        day or whatever.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (50:36):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        And then they're selling courses or you see a lot of e-commerce
        companies saying, Hey, we're doing like 5 million a year. It's okay. At
        the end of the day, how much is that and what's the margin? Yeah, I
        don't care. Maybe if the margin is 5%, then you can live off it. Oh,
        fine. But everyone is just throw in really big numbers. Well, under the
        hood, we all know it. It just, it's difficult to meet and meet and it's
        difficult to build a business, but from the outside and everyone seems
        to be doing amazing. And especially, I think I touched upon it with VC
        funding and hey, they have so much funding. They have so much funding.
        Put it on LinkedIn, TechCrunch, it's all about big numbers. Everyone
        needs to be bigger, bigger, bigger. And that's what tricked me when I
        was at vx, my first company, I need funding, and now we actually want to
        show other people. You can just build a company, which is like, you can
        live off by yourself without funding. You probably should be an
        engineer. That helps a lot, but it's job. I was like, yeah, we want to
        also be a bit more real. Does that make sense?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Ferdinand Goetzen (51:47):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Yeah, yeah. And you also recently launched another company UNI hosted.
        Can you briefly tell us what is that about and how it happened? What is
        your, let's put it this way, deciding to launch another company. When
        you're running a company in the indie hacker world, it's pretty
        standard. You see a lot of indie hackers with several ventures in the
        funded startup world. It's like a no-go. You've got to be like 100% in
        on one thing. How do you balance that? So how did you come to make that
        decision? Wait, first of all, what is it? How did you come to make that
        decision? How did you balance your focus and how did you align that with
        your co-founder?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (52:31):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Yeah, no good questions. Well, I'll just give you a bit of context to
        actually understand how it happened. So Ari and I have simple analytics.
        We're just with the two of us, and we rented an office, I think it was
        two years ago, but the office was too big for us. So it was like eight
        people could fit. We were only with the two of us. So we put on Twitter
        or X, we put any indie hackers, which in the hackers, maybe for people
        listening, it's just people building their own stuff, own products, but
        it's kind of focused on building and SaaS. So we were like any Indy
        hackers that just want to share an office with us so we can Indie
        hacker, Amsterdam office. We got a lot of responses. And one guy, he was
        building a crypto app and he joined us for a day.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (53:19):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        He was a chill guy. He was like, okay, you can rent the office. He was
        like, okay, one of our mates is also also for an office. So we met him,
        he got in and that was DRIs. And DRIs was building, he was in between
        jobs and he was building a unified uni hosted, he was building uni
        hosted at the time. I had no idea what it was. So he was in our office
        and I was like, Hey, what are you working on? And he said, yeah, is this
        wifi management system, but I'm self-hosting it. And yeah, it's really
        annoying. So I'm making solutions to make it like a cloud hosted. This
        didn't bring any bells with me. It's really technical stuff. Yeah, what
        is this? Well, okay, basically how I tell it to people is you have your
        wifi stuff, like the things which are mounted to the ceiling, and you
        have those at home, but you maybe have one tool at home.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (54:17):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        So you don't need a system to manage those. But if you have a big
        building and you have maybe say hundreds of those things and one is
        broken, you have this management system that you can reboot it or so you
        can basically remotely fix wifi at certain locations. Well, this
        management system is provided by the wifi provider, but you need to host
        this management solution. So you need to figure out hosting, you need to
        figure out when the firm of the company doesn't update. You need to
        update the thing. You need to make backups. So that's why there's always
        this IT guy walking around at big offices. And you have IT service
        businesses that take care of this for office buildings and really big
        companies. So what DRIs actually did, he took the solution and he was
        like, let me automate it. So let me host it for you.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">Iron Brands (55:18):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        So you don't need to care about hosting. So we'll host it, we'll do the
        backups, we'll do maintain security, we'll provide the updates for you.
        So it's basically like a done for you host management system. So as an
        IT service business, you don't need to care about that. But at the time
        I was like, what the fuck is this? I have no idea. And he was building
        it because he's just in infrastructure and servers and wifi. So he told
        me the thing and I went to Arian and said, okay, go look at this guy. I
        think he's building something interesting and look at his code and let
        me know what you think. And Arian came back to me, he's like, man, this
        is interesting. So both of us went to this and said, Hey, you want to
        this, spin this into a company? And he was like a company, how do I do
        that? And how does that work? Well we just started off from there, but
        by no means I had an intention to start another business, but just
        sometimes it just click and then you just figure it out and it works.

      <p class="mt-0">
        Yes. Well it's like almost three KMRR, but it's like the ideal perfect
        SaaS is just difficult to build, but quite easy to maintain high
        margins. And so I working a day a week on it to get, is working more on
        it. But yeah, that's just slow and steadily increasing and it's actually
        that's super nice. And one thing we were thinking about, when would you
        engage with something new? Because there's always lack of focus on the
        project that is really going well. And then for us is we made this
        little framework which basically says, what does a company or a project
        that we want to work on need to check? So we wanted, and it's kind of
        the other way around of how we normally would do, but I was like, okay,
        is there already competition in the market? Yes. Check validation. Okay,
        I'm being very short.

        Okay. A company is a B2B check. Okay, there's money there. Are there any
        SEO opportunities for long term? If there are just check ush, whatever.
        And if you see, all right, we can manage to get traffic to our website
        within a couple of months. Jack. And then there was one other thing. Oh
        yeah. Can we outcompete the competition just with a single angle? Just
        so if they are very expensive, can we make a free plan If they people go
        rave on their own Facebook that they have shitty support, can we get
        proper support? Can we get a brand? Are they good at seo O not okay. Can
        we outcompete them there And uni host that like check, check, check. And
        I was like, alright, maybe just let's go. We have to go now. Have you

        Yeah, I just basically tipped it off already, but the face bump for me
        was LinkedIn, but obviously doesn't come in a surprise that maybe not
        into LinkedIn because I think it's a lot of fluff and VC funding,
        basically the narrative we just touch upon. But lately, I think you saw
        the post I posted with, I just think you responded on it for the
        listeners, I made a screenshot of people that use AI on LinkedIn and I
        didn't think about a long time about a post, but I saw it on Twitter and
        I just reposted it on LinkedIn with a title. LinkedIn is Fox. And then
        it got took off. I had no idea because normally that's also funny, if
        you think really hard about a post and you one thing, thousand whatever
        likes. But it was just people that are using AI to respond to a post and
        they were just basically saying exactly the same to get more engagement
        or whatever. And just brings out, I don't think LinkedIn was already a
        super authentic place, but now it's just

        nice one to have. And face poem, I would say I struggle a bit to find
        one this week, but I would say all the time that you work in companies
        and that you get a CEO or a founder as a marketing team that tries to,
        okay, structure better your work in your marketing team, we want to know
        what you work on. Plan sprints. And so you do that and the moment that
        you do that, they still come every day with, oh, and you're going to do
        that and you're going to add that. So at the of Sprint doesn't do
        anything. I think that's something that's for me, it's quite fun.

        to a lot of VCs that I'm seeing that after the market changed, they were
        like, no profitability, of course that's the goal, that's the most
        important. And they were all acted as if that was always their stance.
        And now two months later, three months later, the market has calmed down
        a bit, probably just temporarily. And now they're all going back to the
        old ways. You're seeing the same kind of attitudes. Not all, but some.
        So a face pump to those. And yeah, I totally agree on the hardest Giza
        thing by the way. Incredible getting over them. To our last part, which
        is just rapid fire questions. These are very, very one or two word
        answers,

        To start. Well, I can explain there's a bit more to it. It is a super
        cliche, but this has helped me so good in the sense that everyone wants
        to be an entrepreneur are things about the life of an entrepreneur.
        Everyone is making plans and strategy and everyone loves that and
        everyone has business ideas, but there's only just a few that actually
        try something
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">

        And people start reading business books. But you're basically
        procrastinating actually because you're reading, you're not doing
        anything and you think you're getting smarter or ahead, but there's
        still nothing. And you just need to get out there and you can get out
        there really easily because now you can spin up a website and what is
        the easiest thing you can do? Maybe or just start a newsletter, start
        writing and from writing people start reading it. And you want more
        people, you want to have more readers and you actually iterate on that
        and you meet people and you get into conversations and then at one point
        you actually get somewhere, but you need to do this really small thing
        to get the ball rolling. I never thought I would be at Simple Analytics
        now because I didn't think of the idea. And also I would be a hundred
        miles away from Host, which I still completely not understand sometimes.
        But it just happened. It happened to me because I just went out there
        and I did some stupid stuff with my previous company. Some stuff didn't
        work, but I got to meet a lot of people. You just need to get out there
        and do something and don't think reading books and pitch decks and all
        that bullshit is going to work.

        Oh, good one. Okay. And I think I have a last one. Alright, so if you go
        on your LinkedIn, you can see that you're actually quite public about
        what's the current a RR of your companies. So you said that one of your
        goals is to reach a million a r for simple analytics. I'm going to ask
        you to give me a date on when that's going to happen and then we're
        going to see how far off you are when you actually reached the goal.

        And one thing which may be interesting, if you are at the point of
        starting something or you don't really know you want to bootstrap
        building, there's one day a month we actually host Internet Friends,
        which is like a nerd meetup. There's 20 guys at our office just drinking
        beer and pizza. But it all kind of in Yers that live in Amsterdam, I
        post on it on eggs. So you'll see it if you follow me. But feel free
        just to hang out with us, grab a beer and talk to some interesting
        people.
