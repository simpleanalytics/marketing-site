        Adriaan van Rossum is the founder of Simple Analytics, an alternative to
        Google Analytics. However, with a full focus on user privacy, he's built
        his indie business from scratch to his full-time job today. And in this
        video, he takes us through the whole journey, how he first started it,
        how he learned what he needed to know to set up and run the business,
        how it runs today, and his plans for the future. Let's jump right into
        it.

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Adriaan van Rossum (00:28):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        My name is Adriaan van Rossum. I never know how to pronounce it
        correctly in English, but I think this will do. I have my business, and
        it's called Simple Analytics. So basically it's Google Analytics, but
        then privacy friendly. And within these times it's super important to
        care about privacy because a lot of business, so there's definitely a
        use for businesses that do. And I started when I was 14 with
        programming. I think programming is a great skill if you want to build a
        SaaS product. And I have been interested in privacy since I started
        programming because then you can do so many different things that you
        can do. You can read the clipboards like a very old browser, internet
        Explorer, maybe some people know them still. They were around for quite
        a bit, but there was, I think Internet Explorer 6 or something, and you
        could even read the clipboard of all your visitors online.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">(01:35):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        And then I thought, yeah, this is bad. Technology is great. You can do
        so many things, but you can also read clipboard from people that's very
        privacy invasive. So that's where the starting point basically was for
        my interest in privacy. And since then I've been working for bosses,
        I've been having my own businesses, but when it really clicked was when
        I started working on Simple Analytics. And I think that is because my
        expertise, like development was linked together with my passion and it
        was privacy. So I think it's great to have a motivational force within
        your product that you can rely on because there are so many times in
        building a product that you don't really have motivation. And it's great
        if you then can get the motivation out of your own passion. So what the
        job entails I think, or the function entails is so many things.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">(02:45):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        It's doing your own sales, it's doing your own marketing strategy, it's
        building your product, it's building your product in code or no code,
        whatever you prefer. And there's so many things that you don't know yet.
        There's always some kind of thing that's outside of your comfort zone.
        For me, it's doing the sales and marketing. I think for a lot of
        founders, that is the problem or the challenge and for a lot of other
        founders, it's getting the product out there, which is also very hard if
        you are detailed oriented like me, for example. So yeah, that's
        basically what you do. You have to do everything that's inside of your
        business and you have to make it fun if you don't enjoy it at that time.
        And usually if something is difficult to do, you can always convert it
        to something that like, Hey, I dunno how to do this yet.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">(03:39):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Let's figure out how we can do this. And for example, at the moment I'm
        focusing on sales and marketing way more than I was in the beginning. I
        was lucky that I got some exposure on Hacker News and stuff like that
        because I wrote some blocks, some articles, but I wasn't really
        approaching businesses and getting businesses into my subscriptions. And
        now I'm doing that way more with way more tools like I developed myself.
        And it's great to see that it works. So especially if something is hard
        for you and you can make it work, the reward of you doing it finally and
        it works and it works out. That's great.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">James Daly (04:29):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Before you were doing what you're doing now, before you were running
        Simple Analytics, what were you doing before then? Were you working in 9
        to 5? Did you have a full-time job? What was the most recent thing you
        were doing before you were self-employed?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Adriaan van Rossum (04:41):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Yeah, before Simple Analytics, I was working at a business as a
        developer here in Amsterdam, and I was doing another, I was basically a
        9 to 5 job, but then three days a week I never believed in working full
        time. And also I had the advantage of being a programmer, so then you
        can charge a little bit more and have a little bit more free time. So I
        did that and I used that perks as well to travel around the world. I was
        allowed to work remotely, so I lived in Las Palmas for half a year. So
        that was great. There was all possible within that business and it felt
        okay, but it also felt like I was missing something. I wasn't getting to
        my full potential, I would say. So yeah, I knew I needed to run my own
        business and start on something, but I was too comfortable in the
        situation. I wasn't. So then I realised, okay, I need to change this.
        And so I quit my job before I had another business, and then I started
        working on my business and then all of a sudden there was this urge to
        make this business successful because otherwise you don't have income.
        So I worked very hard on Simple Analytics for two months and then
        launched it, and that was how it started basically. So I was just
        working for a boss as a front-end developer, working for them like three
        days a week and that was it.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">James Daly (06:20):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        That's really cool that you ended up being able to travel whilst still
        working at a job and it would give you the time to start setting up for
        your own business, I guess if you're only working three days a week,
        that's an ideal scenario to transition.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Adriaan van Rossum (06:32):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        But the funny part for me was that I didn't really start my own business
        because I was still feeling comfortable with the situation I was in, and
        I really started doing my business when all those perks were gone. I
        didn't have any income anymore. And then I started working hard on my
        own business because I wanted to succeed, and otherwise I was always
        working on the site a little bit. But yeah, I don't believe in side
        projects that much, but it's different for everybody of course. But for
        me, it works to throw away your old shoes and then buy new ones very
        quickly.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">James Daly (07:08):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        You're right, there's no real incentive. Not being able to afford food
        is there. You really need to make it work then if you have no other
        income.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Adriaan van Rossum (07:17):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        And I'm also like, I don't have a family, I don't have responsibilities.
        So that's also something that should be taken into account. Not that
        everybody can do that, but I was in, I could do that because of that.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">James Daly (07:33):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        I guess When you left your previous job, you hadn't started Simple
        Analytics then, had you? No. So when you left your previous job, what
        was in your mind? Were you thinking I'll start a business? Did you
        already have Simple Analytics in your mind or were you just thinking, I
        need freedom, I need some time to myself and then I'll figure out what
        to do next?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Adriaan van Rossum (07:50):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        So when I left my previous role or job, I didn't have any idea what I
        was doing next. So I went to, oh, yeah, that's an important factor that
        I didn't tell yet. I also had some freelance gigs as well, so I was
        starting
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">(08:15):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Working on those after my job, but those are limited. There's a
        limitation on amount of jobs you get and you can get more, but then
        you're in the same situation as comfort and then you don't work anymore
        on your own business. So what I did, I remember I was working in rif,
        also one of the Canary Islands. I was working there on a freelance gig
        and then I realised I was implementing Google Analytics for some client
        and I was like, this is bad. There's no real good alternative and I'm
        implementing Google Analytics again. And I already developed a little
        bit of a thing against big data collection companies like Google and
        Google Analytics. And then I realised, okay, let's change this. And I
        was having this freelance gig and then I also had more of a feeling
        like, okay, now I have an idea, I can work it out and now I can also
        stop the freelance gig. And then I focused on Simple Analytics, but at
        the same time I didn't know where to start, so I didn't know what to do,
        how to stay motivated, all those things. So I was looking for an online
        community as well. And that's I think a very important factor. Having a
        community build it out in the open works for me very well. So you get
        some kind of, how do you call it? Not commitment, but
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">James Daly (10:08):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">Accountability.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Adriaan van Rossum (10:09):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Accountability, yeah. Perfect. So you get some accountability to keep
        going and it worked very well. So I think for me, the feeling moving
        from that freelance gig previous, I thought it was the job, but it was a
        freelance gig. Moving from the freelance gig to my own business, it was
        feeling like, okay, finally I'm going to start it and I'm going to do it
        right. And you never know if it's going to be right. The first company
        usually fails, but I had done so many projects already, so I hope like,
        okay, this is maybe the 10th project and the 10th will probably succeed.
        And that's what I say, right? If you do a project, the first one is very
        likely not to succeed, and if you do 10, you have maybe one that works.
        So yeah, that's what I
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">James Daly (10:58):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Did. You mentioned at the very beginning, there's so many things that
        come with being an indie founder. You've got the actual building of the
        product, but then there's also the marketing, managing income and tax
        and customer acquisition. How did you learn all of that side of things?
        I mean, you learned development through your own interest in the
        previous job. What about the rest of all the stuff that comes with it?
        Did you learn it on the fly? Did you read any books, follow any blogs,
        or you just kind of figured it out as you went along?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Adriaan van Rossum (11:25):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Yeah, there's a few different aspects that you have to learn as an indie
        founder, and one of the aspects is you need to build your product. And
        that's something that I already knew. So I learned that before I started
        my business, but it still is not the full picture of building a product.
        Something that I really needed to learn is building a product that was
        okay and not perfect. Something that a lot of founders, and especially
        with founders of a technical background, are very, very, yeah, how do
        you call it? Find it hard to stop at a certain moment and say like,
        okay, this product is finished perfections, they're not using them most.
        Yeah, exactly. They're not using the latest tools and all that kind of
        stuff. So within development, I already learned how to develop with what
        I needed to learn in my business is to stop at a certain moment, use the
        tools that I already know and use those to build my product.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">(12:25):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        So there was one part that I really needed to learn, and I learned that
        by seeing people doing it online, saying, okay, I need to validate my
        product within let's say a few months or a month, and then if people are
        interested in your product. So I thought, okay, let's do that as well.
        Let's focus on getting validated and getting your product out there
        instead of making it perfect from the start. So that's what I did for
        the development and building the part, building the product. And then
        indeed, you also have doing the sales and marketing. There are so many
        examples still. I'm just looking around and there's so many different
        tactics, so many different ways to do it, but what made it easier for my
        business is that I care about privacy. So there's a lot of tactics that
        already are impossible to do because I don't want to track a user, I
        don't want to use retention, I don't want to use ads.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">(13:28):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        So there's so many things that I don't want to use. So there's some
        logical things that are left over which I can focus on, but then still
        you have to choose. You have to choose. For example, I recently added a
        little pop-up on my website where potential customers can say, Hey, what
        is your biggest challenge? And they can then pick for like, okay, I
        don't want a cookie banner, or I have to comply with privacy laws, or I
        want an easy to use platform so they can pick what they want. And then I
        ask, okay, what other tool do you use? Most of them say Google
        Analytics, and I ask their website. So then they will fill in the
        website and their email address, and then later it's all what a customer
        does or a potential visitor or visitor does for you. And it's not like
        data I get from another party or from some smart marketing tool.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">(14:25):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        It's all from a user that is just visiting my website and they don't get
        into some system that will spend them all the time. It'll be just me
        responding to that email and saying like, Hey, we have this product and
        it might help you because you answer these questions. So then you have
        certain marketing tools that work from privacy perspective and also from
        a user perspective. And you maybe get a little bit less of customers
        because of that. But I'm fine with that because my whole business is
        around privacy, and I don't want to have my lending page full with
        trackers and privacy invasive tools for my visitors of course, because
        it's basically the image of my business that gets hurt if I don't do
        that. And then learning how to do taxes and how to do all the other
        stuff like content, basically it's just doing, it's not really going
        into the books and try to find out how to do it best because there's no
        one way to do it. There are so many ways. So you just try and what works
        you keep doing and what doesn't work you stop doing. And I think that's
        the most important thing is keep doing it.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">(15:48):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Even, I don't know if you have a new idea or you, there's a great
        podcast about how to get more customers, try it. And if it works for
        you, it works. And if you stay motivated on doing so, please keep doing
        it. That's basically my advice for if you want to do the marketing of
        your business, try out so many things and keep trying.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">James Daly (16:14):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        It's one of the best things about being a solo founder is you have that
        freedom to quickly try things, to test something out in one day, see the
        result, adjust. There's no marketing team to go through, no committee,
        nothing. No, you can just do it. It's great. Have that kind, just do it.
        Yeah, I never thought about actually the limitations Simple Analytics
        would have in marketing due to being private, but you're right, that is
        something to consider. But you're right, it really does give you higher
        quality customers, I think, because they then see that you walk the
        talk, you do what you talk about even in your own marketing, and they
        trust you further because of that. That is very interesting.

        Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Especially in the privacy space. Yeah.

        What's the best thing about being self-employed? What do you enjoy the
        most about working for yourself?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Adriaan van Rossum (17:04):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Well, it's funny that you asked that because it's very hard to, let me
        rephrase this a bit. When I was working for a boss, it was very easy for
        me to say, okay, I want to work three days a week and not anymore and
        not any longer. I would just go home after my eight hours or whatever
        and I'll do my thing at night and meet friends or I don't know, do some
        hobby, and now I'm working for my own business. And it's way harder
        because you have all the freedom that you do, but you're also
        responsible for those next customers, for doing the customer support.
        You get an email from a customer, you want to reply to it, you get an
        alert on your system and you want to look what's going on, or there's so
        many things that you're now responsible for. And if you're working for a
        business, you're usually responsible for one or two things.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">(18:01):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        In my business or in my job, I was responsible for the front end code.
        So if that's on production and there's a bug, yeah, I will fix it. And
        if it's after office hours, of course I'll fix it, but that's maybe an
        hour work, and then I will never have that for a few months because that
        doesn't happen often. But it's very hard to do that as a solo founder
        because you feel responsible for everything that you're doing. So yeah,
        it's a good question. I think recently I'm starting to force myself more
        into things that I enjoy. So I started to do kite surfing quite a bit
        and it feels great, but I really have to make myself do it. So I
        challenge myself to do this every week and then during the week, so not
        on the weekends, but just an advantage of a solar foundry.

        You can do it right in the middle of the week. You don't have any other
        things that are super required for that certain day. So if you don't
        have meetings or appointments, you can just go guide surfing. So that's
        something that I do now, and it feels great because then you're just out
        on the water. It's like almost nobody is there and you come home and
        you're completely tired, but tired in a different way than you would be
        tired from working, right? So yeah, it's good to keep yourself also on
        a, how do you call it, and not professional or outside of work skill,
        keep yourself entertained or do stuff that you really like to do because
        it is possible. And if you don't do it now, you're probably not going to
        do it later as well. So keep on doing the fun stuff.

        Oh God, yeah. What's been the high point so far? Has there been an
        accomplishment you've hit or a career goal you've hit or something
        you've done that you've thought, this feels incredible, this is why I've
        started my own company, this is what it's all about. Has there been a
        high point yet?

        If I have to describe my high point in my business career, I would say
        it feels just great to have a business that can sustain yourself, and
        it's something that you work for. You work towards something that, okay,
        I can live from my own business, but it's a little bit vague, but once
        you have this certain threshold or this certain milestone, I sometimes
        realise, oh, I'm super lucky with this position. I don't have to do
        freelance work. I don't have to have a part-time job. I can just live
        from a business that I really enjoy. And obviously you don't enjoy it,
        all of it. You also have to do the taxes or you have to do some things
        you don't like. But most of it is just like, oh, everything that I do is
        for my own business. And that feels great, and that's definitely a great
        achievement in what I think business should be. It's too bad it's around
        money, but it's more like, it's also some kind of a feeling that you are
        independent now, and maybe it's the same feeling when you're living at
        your parents and then you finally go leave the house and you go live by
        yourself. I think that's a similar feeling. So you're then doing it on
        your own, and that's a great feeling.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-0">
        I think a lot of people, when they get to the point where they are, you
        are always looking ahead at the next thing, but the fact that you are
        independent financially is such a huge achievement. That is a high point
        on its own. Yeah, I love the metaphor for moving out of your parents'
        house as well. It feels just like that. Okay, so what does your typical
        work day look like? You can set your own schedule, you work for
        yourself, run through an average day. Do you sleep in, do start work
        really early? What does your average day look like at work?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Adriaan van Rossum (22:22):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        My average day at work looks a bit like all over the place, but recently
        how my life works is I do something in a certain way and I do it a few
        times, then I realise I don't want to do it, and then I'm changing it
        over, do something else. So what I'm saying now is probably not so
        relevant in a few months, but this is how I do it now. When wake up, my
        girlfriend usually is already awake. She starts working in the living
        room, and then I'm waking up slightly later, and then I go to my
        coworking space. I have a coworking space here in Amsterdam, and I
        really love to have some kind of workspace where you meet other people.
        So you are not by yourself alone or always is the same person. It's good
        to have some workplace, even in the house, you have a different room
        where you work or something like that. So that's how I start my day. I
        just bike to my workplace, my coworking space, get some coffee. Usually
        I plan some calls in the morning, so basically at nine o'clock or 10. So
        I have a motivation to be in the office on time, because otherwise I
        might be a little bit later in the office, like 11 or 12. So it's great
        to have this motivation to set, call, set an appointment at nine or 10,
        and then I'm in the office.

        It works. Little life hacks. But yeah, it works. And then I just start
        working on something that I put in my calendar before. So I usually have
        my calendar with time slots, and I just move time slots around during
        the week where they seem to fit best. Usually after a call, I will do
        something that's not intensive for the brain, so just some little coding
        or something. And if I have the first time slot of the days totally
        free, then I will write some content or something that's for my brain a
        little bit tougher. So that's how I feel my days. And then I try to stop
        working around six or seven, then I bike home and start relaxing at home
        or doing some renovating the apartment with, I dunno, stuff like that.
        Just like entertainment and something that's not a digital hobby.
        Basically doing something with boots or doing something to entertain
        myself without the bits and the bites

        If you had to give your past self from a few years ago, some advice with
        Simple Analytics, with working for yourself to make what you do now a
        bit easier, make your journey a bit easier, is there any advice you
        would give your past self?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Adriaan van Rossum (25:31):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        If it would give my future self advice when I was a few years younger, I
        would say stop studying and start working on your own business. I spent
        too much time finishing some degree that you don't really need.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">(25:48):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        And eventually I finished a non-related programming, how you call it
        course, basically in the Netherlands it works like this. If you study,
        you get a certain loan and if you finish your study, the loan will
        become a gift. But if you don't finish a study, you have to pay back the
        loan. That's how it worked a few years ago when I studied. So I spent a
        lot of time finishing that study and I switched a few studies and
        whatever. So eventually I finished that. And yeah, it's good from a
        money perspective, it's saves you a few thousand euros, not that much,
        but it's bad. From an entrepreneurial standpoint, I would say I would've
        been happier I think if I didn't do the studying, but I was working on
        my own business and I was always doing side projects next to my study
        and I enjoyed it way more.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">(26:58):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        But if I would've found a community within Amsterdam or within the
        Netherlands where I could work on my own project and align businesses
        and I got motivation from other people around me, then I would
        definitely be way younger and already have a successful business, I
        would say. And that would've made me happier at that time. I think. I
        also believe that the time when you study is also important. It's a
        certain age and you meet new people and you have a lot of time to meet
        new people, which is also great. So it's not like that the whole time is
        something that's bad in my life. But I would say if I could replace the
        studying with building actual business, that would've been way better
        for me.

        Do you have any resources that you could recommend that helped you in
        this whole journey? Is there any kind of books, audio books, podcasts,
        websites, blogs, anything that you read that really gave you, well not
        necessarily read or listened to, came across any sort of resources that
        you found very useful that you might recommend?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Adriaan van Rossum (28:05):
      </p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        Yeah, I have a few resources I think that helped me work on my business.
        And one that I read when I started creating my business was a book from
        James Wat, he's the founder or one of the founders of the Brew Dock
        company. They have great IPAs. The punk IPA is one of their famous
        beers, and he writes about starting a business and it's physical
        business. He's selling actual beer, so it's not like a SaaS business or
        something, but he's telling about his marketing strategy and he's really
        thinking outside of the box. And it's a very nice way of writing. It
        really appealed to me. And for example, I don't know, bought a big old
        army tank, drove it in London Square and said, we're going to change
        things around here. Well, it's obviously very illegal to do stuff like
        that, but it said them in the spotlight directly in the whole town of
        London and outside of it.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">(29:14):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        But it was a great smart technique to get into the picture. And he
        describes as building a brand that you need to find an audience that can
        believe in something. So you need to sell. He is better wording for it
        than I do, but sell a mission, sell something that people can jump on,
        okay, go for, we going to fight this or we going to do this. We got to
        change this in the world. And my mission is to change the world into a
        more privacy friendly place. And if you can have people jump on the
        train and believe in your mission, then they are also likely to believe
        in your brand and be loyal to your mission and your brand. So he is not
        selling beers, but he's selling like, we're going to change the world
        with good beers and we're going to take over all the old breweries that
        are just brewing shitty beers.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">(30:12):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        We're going to change the world. And of course, changing the world's
        just tiny bit of the world. But I really enjoyed reading that book. So
        that was definitely a great inspiration for starting my business. And
        another inspiration that I still check regularly is marketing examples.
        Harry has some great examples and he always writes them very clear, just
        like with a little box, this is the right way, this is the wrong way.
        You see the difference. Okay. Point across. So it's super clear how he
        communicates. Yeah, his examples. So that's also great source of content
        that you can check regularly, subscribe to his newsletter. It's really
        good. Yeah, that's basically the two things that really helped me
        running my business.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">James Daly (31:07):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        What are you working on next? What goals do you have? Is there anything
        exciting on the roadmap that you want to tease a little bit?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">
        Adriaan van Rossum (31:13):

      <p class="mt-0">
        What is next for Simple Analytics is something that I'm really excited
        about. There are a few things, but I will name the first thing, and
        maybe I hint to the next one. But the first thing is, what is important
        for so many businesses is that how good is my page and what is the
        quality of my page? And within analytics tools, there are so many
        analytics tools, it's not really clear what the quality is of a page. So
        you can see how many visits a page got. For example, you can see, okay,
        this page about this certain blog post goes like a thousand views last
        week. So it's really good blog post, but you don't really know that
        maybe someone shared it on LinkedIn or on Twitter, and that's because
        you got those thousand views. It doesn't say anything about the blog
        post itself. So what we are building at the moment is having an
        indicator next to your page view list, and that indicator shows this
        blog post or this page is good content and this is worst content.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-0">(32:30):</p>
      <p class="mt-0">
        And it doesn't use any data points like page views or anything like
        that. It uses two data points, basically how far someone scrolled on
        your page. So if you have a long blog post, it measures like, okay, they
        scroll to half of it, well then they probably didn't see the whole blog
        post. So it's probably not a quality reader or a quality read and how
        long someone is on the page. So if someone is reading your blog post for
        five minutes and it's scroll all the way down to the last word, it's
        probably a good blog post. And if a lot of people are doing this, it'll
        probably count to like, okay, this blog post is really good. So in that
        way you can calculate how well your content is doing instead of how well
        your content is doing traffic wise. So I think that will be a major
        difference in analytics for a lot of content creators, for article
        writers, if you have content on your website, it's super relevant to
        know, okay, people like this page more than my other page. So you all of
        a sudden start having a different metric that you didn't have before. So
        that's something I'm really excited about and I know a lot of customers
        will be really happy with this new feature. And there's also somewhere
        in the future we are going to do something with alerts, but that's all
        I'm going to say about that.
