      <h2>Case Study: How Adriaan makes $36k/mo taking on Google Analytics.</h2>

      <p>
        My name is Adriaan van Rossum. I have a business called Simple
        Analytics. Basically, what we do is an alternative to Google Analytics.
        If you're familiar with Google Analytics, you'll know they track
        cookies, have an annoying cookie banner, and collect a lot of data for
        ad systems. Simple Analytics does none of that. We just track your
        visitors without cookies and without a cookie banner.
      </p>

      <h2>How did you get your first 10 customers, subscribers, or patrons?</h2>
      <p>
        Yeah. So getting the first customers for Simple Analytics was a bit of
        luck, but also like making sure you were in the places where luck
        happens, you know? Not just waiting around and seeing if it works, but
        doing the effort and seeing what works.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me, it was posting it on Product Hunt. I think it was 2018,
        September. I was really excited. I was like, 'Okay, this is my first
        business I'm going to post on Product Hunt. I have some friends who will
        vote for me, and I will become like the product of the day.'
      </p>

      <p>
        That didn't happen, but I got like third. I was like, 'Ah, that's not
        great.' Like, 'Ah, I want something better.' I put so much time in it. I
        also had a video created with some friends. They were studying
        videography, I think it was in Belgium. They have a great school there,
        and they were happy to make a video for me. So we made a great video of
        a guy being tracked all the time. I was just working on my computer, and
        then there was someone snooping around me or watching me from the back
        and stuff like that. It's still on the website of Simple Analytics, so
        you can still watch it. It's kind of a funny video.
      </p>

      <p>
        I thought, 'Okay, this is maybe something that people enjoy,' and then
        maybe they'll start to think about the business behind it. But for
        Product Hunt, it didn't really work. So then I went to Hacker News the
        next day. I was sitting on a park bench somewhere in Amsterdam. A friend
        of mine was there, and we were like, 'Okay, let's put it online and then
        we can talk.'
      </p>

      <p>
        I put it online on Hacker News, and then I thought something was wrong
        with the website. It was on the first spot of the website, but maybe
        that's just because it's the new page or something. So I was like,
        'Okay, there's nothing going on yet.' But then I realized it got a lot
        of upvotes. I was like, 'Oh, wait a minute, this is going well.' And
        then I realized it was on the front page in the first place, number one
        spot, and stayed there for nine hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        I got a ton of traffic from that. I think it was 30,000 visitors or
        something like that. Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure because my
        platform at that time didn't track visitors - we only had page views. So
        it was a bare-metal platform, and it was only page views. I think 30,000
        page views from Hacker News. It was insane.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was like, 'Oh, this is working.' And that was also directly the moment
        where I got paying customers. I think I got, I'm not sure how many, but
        I think 30 paying customers after that moment. So it means that the
        homepage wasn't great yet and wasn't perfect, but I got customers from
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yeah, that's how I got my first customers. Just trying different places
        and seeing what works and where it works. It was quite a nice surprise
        for me as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think Hacker News works better than Product Hunt because the readers
        of Hacker News are more of a technical background. Product Hunt is more
        for, I think, more shiny, beautiful products. Simple Analytics was more
        of a mission like beating Google and removing all the tracking, and who
        knows the best about tracking? Developers. Developers are building the
        tracking, so they know what is possible within a browser. I think they
        know more about why this could be important, and they care more about
        privacy as well. So my whole business is about privacy, and developers
        know a bit more about privacy than the people on Product Hunt, I think.
      </p>

      <h2>What was your first big win, and how did it shape your business?</h2>

      <p>
        One of the events that really helped me push to the next level was the
        product's Hacker News launch. It got some traffic, and I realised that
        those people loved my product. I needed to focus more on that platform.
        Subsequently, I targeted more developers that I needed to convince on my
        platform. Later, I realised this was also how companies would switch
        from Google Analytics to Simple Analytics, for example, because the
        developer knows they can change to something like this. They read Hacker
        News, so they think, "I know about Simple Analytics and it's a great
        platform."
      </p>

      <p>
        They will tell their boss, "Hey, maybe we should switch to something
        that's more privacy-friendly."
      </p>

      <p>
        I think that way of sales, I hadn't realised before, but through Hacker
        News, I realised these are the people that actually sell within the
        business.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, later I got some people saying, "Oh, my husband's a
        programmer, and he told me about Simple Analytics. I'm a marketer, but I
        want to have it in my business too." That was, I think, the first moment
        where I actually realised that maybe the developers are salespeople.
        That's not normally the case - they're not typically salesy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Much later in the business, last year, we tried to make this even bigger
        by giving everybody a free plan so that anyone could use Simple
        Analytics for free.
      </p>

      <p>
        We hope, and we're seeing this in our data now, that these people are
        using Simple Analytics for free for their blog posts or something else.
        It may be a small website, but when they discuss analytics in their
        business, they're going to say, "Oh, I use this at home, and it's great.
        Maybe we should use it in our business."
      </p>

      <p>
        Then we charge a fee. So the developers get it free, but the people who
        actually use it as a company will pay for it. Sometimes when we get a
        sales request, we look up the person on LinkedIn, and we can see that
        this person already had an account with us on a small website with a
        free plan but is now talking inside a business. So you can actually see
        that it worked.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's really cool. You make a few assumptions, and you don't know if
        they'll work. When you see some results and think, "Oh, this is actually
        working," then you're super happy. That's nice in business - you can go
        two ways, and sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.
      </p>

      <p>
        To push people in the right direction for helping us and making our
        business known in companies, we have some things in place, like an
        affiliate programme, but I don't really think it works that well because
        if people enjoy your product, they're going to share it anyway. If they
        can make money with it, they share it on a different basis than if they
        were really excited about the product. So I'm a bit on the fence about
        that strategy.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think it's good if you want to attract lots of customers through
        another party. For example, we are in some boilerplate codes so that you
        have a boilerplate for your website and you just build your website
        starting with a few lines of code. Being in those boilerplates is super
        nice because they already use Simple Analytics with a few lines of code.
        So for those people, it makes sense to have an incentive of making money
        based on that little script that we add. But I think for general word of
        mouth, it's not that important.
      </p>

      <h2>How do you structure and manage your week?</h2>

      <p>
        Yeah, we manage our time quite differently every year or month. I think
        if I need to answer something like this in a year, it will be completely
        different than if I answer it now. So take that into account.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the moment, or rather last year, we needed to do a lot of things that
        just needed to be done. We had a new free plan, which required lots of
        coding and system design work. So we had quite a pile of tasks to
        complete.
      </p>

      <p>
        I remember when we went to Bali in November, I was trying to make the
        experience a bit nicer. I said to my business partner, Iron, "Let's go
        to Bali and do fun projects that maybe aren't the most profitable, but
        are enjoyable to build." I think it's important in a business to have
        fun projects or elements that make people smile. For example, in our
        emails, we have GIFs of Iron and me reacting to different situations -
        positive ones, when people leave, or when payments are late.
      </p>

      <p>
        These fun things don't necessarily make more money, but they give people
        a smirk for a second, and that's worth something. Regarding time
        management - I'm drifting a bit - but in Bali, we really wanted to do
        those fun projects. However, there was still this list of essential
        tasks that needed completing. I decided to focus the first week on
        finishing those tasks, which extended throughout the month until
        everything was done.
      </p>

      <p>
        So our plan to do fun projects in Bali changed to "let's just finish
        these tasks". That was the theme of last year - we just needed to do a
        lot of stuff. This year is different because last year we set up more of
        a platform for growth, and now we're focusing on the growth itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Last year we implemented the free plan, and this year we're ensuring
        perfect conversion and increasing user acquisition. This allows more
        time to think about the business rather than just working in it. We're
        now at a point where we can think more about the next steps instead of
        just completing tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        For tools, we use Trello - it's super simple. We just drag items to
        "done". We have one column for bigger ideas, another for specific tasks
        we want to complete within a few weeks, and a "done" column. It's a very
        simple system, but it works best for our small team of two people plus
        some freelancers.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have an agreement that if it's in Trello, it's the truth and will get
        done at some point. If it's not in Trello, you can talk about it, but it
        needs to be added to Trello to become a reality.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What’s the most surprising insight you’ve gained from your audience’s
        feedback?
      </h2>

      <p>
        The most surprising response, I think, was for Simple Analytics to build
        this ad blocker bypassing feature. Like Simple Analytics and many other
        analytics tools, though not as much as Google Analytics, are blocked by
        ad blockers, right? So when you install an ad blocker in your browser,
        it blocks Google Analytics. Some of those ad blockers also block Simple
        Analytics. We thought, "Okay, this is not great. We want to share our
        mission, and these ad blockers are blocking our mission because we are
        trying to do good. We don't track people." So it felt a bit like a punch
        in the face. We're trying to be good, and you're still blocking us.
      </p>

      <p>
        We thought, "Okay, let's bypass ad blockers." I'm quite proud of that
        solution because it's just a creative idea that I thought could work, so
        let's try it out. Basically, what it does is, if you have a domain like
        example.com, you can prefix that with a subdomain. So you can say
        analytics.example.com and link that domain to our platform. If you link
        the domain to our platform, for an ad blocker, it doesn't look like it's
        our platform, but it looks like it's analytics.example.com. So you kind
        of trick the ad blocker into thinking it's on their website instead of
        our website. And that works quite well.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is also a feature where I didn't realise that a lot of people
        actually needed it. Later, I heard from a few customers, "Oh, the reason
        why I'm with Simple Analytics is because of this feature." I was like,
        "Oh, that's big. I didn't know that." Then a lot of other companies
        tried to build the same thing. So that's also a bit where my pride came
        in because I was like, "Oh, people are just copying this feature." But
        it's kind of nice because it shows that other people think it's cool
        too.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I think that's the feature where we got the most feedback, and where
        I was a bit surprised. Yeah.
      </p>

      <h2>What’s your most successful marketing channel and why?</h2>

      <p>
        I don't want to admit it, but our most successful marketing channel is
        Google search. Search is our most important marketing channel because
        people look for 'Google Analytics alternative' or 'privacy analytics'.
        That's still the main source of our customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's also a lot of word of mouth, but it's much less than search.
        Search is still the biggest one, though we see a little uptick in AI
        search basically. OpenAI gives us some results as well, which is nice to
        see, but I think all the AI systems still use Google search or Bing
        search for ranking their answers. So SEO is still super important for
        us. That's one of our bigger goals for this year - to improve our SEO
        significantly.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, we're dependent on Google whilst also fighting against
        them. There's this weird imbalance of wanting their search capability
        but not their bad behaviour. It's funny because if they want, they could
        just close our revenue income from search by putting us on page 50, and
        we'd be done. But I don't think they'll ever do that - it wouldn't be
        best for a company that people trust for search.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think the free plan is also an important change, but we don't have
        enough data yet to see if that's the main source. Word of mouth is
        increasing though. We measure how people select their source during
        onboarding - they have options like search, LinkedIn, word of mouth,
        etc. Word of mouth has been increasing over the last few months, but we
        don't have enough data yet to draw firm conclusions.
      </p>

      <p>
        LinkedIn and Twitter are important sources too, but they work slightly
        differently because we're a very open business. When we have a new
        feature, free trial, or strategic changes, we share it. People then know
        what we're doing. While it might not generate sales directly, when
        someone needs analytics, they'll think of us. It's hard to measure
        exactly how much comes from that - it's relatively low compared to
        search, but it's also fun to share on LinkedIn and Twitter (or X).
      </p>

      <p>
        It's nice because now my friends know what I do too. Otherwise, they
        wouldn't understand. LinkedIn is often the only connection we still have
        because most people use it in their office jobs. I hear back from
        friends saying, 'Oh, you're doing this now with your business', which
        they wouldn't know otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think it will become more important in the future as well. The more we
        build with AI, the more important the story and distribution become. If
        you can't reach people, you're done. I think influencers and people who
        have distribution are becoming much more important because they can just
        request a nice app to be built and they already have the distribution.
        That will be a big change in the future.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What’s the most effective way you’ve increased your revenue without
        increasing your workload?
      </h2>

      <p>
        I don't really believe in the concept of low effort and big impact. For
        me and my business, it doesn't work like that. You need to build
        something, then build on top of that, then try something else. If it
        doesn't work, take a step back, go further, and try something else. It's
        quite a slow process.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think a lot of people are looking for big wins. They want to get a
        thousand customers in two days and be successful. But if you keep
        comparing yourself with those extreme examples, you're never going to be
        happy about where you are at the moment. I made the same mistake when I
        started with Simple Analytics. In the second and third year, I was
        really comparing myself to businesses that were doing way better than I
        was. That's quite heavy on a personal level; it makes it difficult to
        enjoy your own work.
      </p>

      <p>
        I would advise not trying to grow too hard, which is a bit odd to say
        because everyone wants to grow fast. But I would say try to do what
        works, and then increase the effort on that every time. Did you have a
        successful blog post? Try to improve it. Did you have a great feature
        that people really love? Make sure all your customers know about it. Or
        write a use case with a customer who's using that feature. Try to build
        on the things that work within your business.
      </p>

      <p>
        These aren't the things that will make you a millionaire in a few
        months, but I think these efforts will work for most businesses more
        often than not. So just go deeper into what already works in your
        business. That's more of a strategy that we use now, and I feel more
        comfortable with it because you can grow slower, and that's okay. You
        don't have to be the next unicorn. You just work on your business and,
        for example, last year we grew by 30%. For us, that's great. For some
        businesses, that's way too slow, but for us, it's okay.
      </p>

      <p>
        We just want to grow every year and improve. We also want to create
        lives that are nice for ourselves, so we can go on holiday or take a few
        days off. We don't work more than four days a week in our business. You
        can make your life nicer than just focusing purely on rapid growth. This
        fits well with a bootstrapped business; you're not dependent on VCs, so
        there's not a lot of stress about needing to grow super fast. You can
        just grow at your own pace and be happy about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think that's a little different from the culture in the US, perhaps,
        with VC-funded startups. Bootstrapped businesses are a good example of
        how you can do things differently.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What’s the smallest change you’ve made that’s had the biggest financial
        impact?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Yeah. So, as simple as you can, at events. If you click on a button, you
        can send an event or submit a form, stuff like that. And it's kind of a
        hidden feature. So not many people actually see the events.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are a lot of companies that build something like a funnel that you
        can drag events into and stuff like that. That's a feature that we call
        'goals'. So then you can have that type of funnel.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the feature that people enjoy more is the events explorer. We built
        this feature where you can see all the events. It's just one table. You
        can filter on it. You can add metadata to it. So if your event happened
        on this page, that page, whatever. It seems like a very simple feature,
        but all of a sudden people realise that they have this mental model of
        events, but they just have it all on one page.
      </p>

      <p>
        I feel like a lot of people are really, really happy with that feature.
        Most of the feedback we get is like, "Hey, can you improve this on the
        events page?" or "Can you improve this on the events explorer?" I didn't
        really realise that people would enjoy it so much. It's such a simple
        way of interacting with the data you have. I've underestimated how many
        people would like this.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, yeah, in hindsight, I should have built this way earlier. It's a
        really cool feature. It sounds super simple. It's just a table with
        numbers and that's it. I added a few nice buttons. So download to Excel,
        download to CSV and stuff. And that's just such an easy interaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes a feature doesn't have to be complicated or have a lot of UI
        and fancy things; sometimes just a page with a table is what people
        want. So that surprised me quite a bit.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What’s your best advice for attracting and keeping your most loyal
        customers?
      </h2>

      <p>
        At Simple Analytics, we try to make most people happy, but you can't
        please everyone. When you remove or change a feature, some people will
        love it while others will hate it because they used it differently.
        There's always a balance between how many people you'll make happy and
        how many you won't.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think the most important thing we try to do well is giving people a
        "wow" experience when they ask for something in support. For example,
        last week a big customer gave feedback on our team member roles
        management. They had a different use case that our version one feature
        didn't accommodate well. They also had questions about the Events
        Explorer, wanting to include page views and other things.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although I had other items on my to-do list, I decided to prioritise
        their requests. I implemented all their recommendations and feature
        requests, then sent them an email with screenshots explaining everything
        we'd done. I asked for their feedback, and they were amazed that we'd
        actually built what they asked for.
      </p>

      <p>
        This kind of experience is only possible if you respond quickly to
        customer requests. If you wait too long, they might not even be a
        customer anymore. I implemented their additional feedback immediately,
        and they said it was the best experience they'd ever had with a software
        company or SaaS tool. They wouldn't expect this level of service from
        larger companies like Google Analytics or Adobe Analytics, which are
        often too big to respond to individual customer feedback.
      </p>

      <p>
        These are the moments where you can really shine as a company. You can
        be agile and make things happen on the spot. As you mentioned earlier,
        having a story or being the face behind the company makes a huge
        difference in how customers see you. Suddenly, you're a human being
        rather than just a faceless system.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What purchase for under $100 has most positively impacted your business?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Yeah, the easiest thing to say is ChatGPT because it has improved so
        many parts of the business. On a feature level, we now offer AI results.
        So if you don't want to look at your data, but you just have a question
        like, "How many people from Belgium are looking at this specific page?",
        in the UI you need to click a few things, but with AI, you just type the
        question.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a personal level, if someone asks something in customer support and
        some people can be quite rough with their feedback, you want to answer
        in a nice way. You always want to have some filter between what you
        actually think and what you type. AI is a perfect filter for me. I can
        just type in however I feel, and it will respond nicely. You always need
        to treat your customers as angels, right? So that's a perfect filter
        between me and the angels.
      </p>

      <p>
        For other things in the business, like writing documentation or having a
        question about code that doesn't work, AI tools are also helpful. I
        think AI tools are the most productive tools ever. We use them a lot for
        coding too, which is just perfect.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's lovable.dev, a beautiful tool to create a very easy MVP on the
        spot. You have features for creating UI with AI. There are so many tools
        out there that the work you actually do as a technical founder is
        shifting more towards generating ideas and thinking of how to implement
        them, or making and playing with designs, rather than actually
        executing. That shift is beautiful, I think.
      </p>

      <p>So yeah, thanks to AI. I pay those bucks with love.</p>

      <h2>
        What’s a recurring habit, process, or system you have that you couldn’t
        function without?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Yeah, for me, the most important thing is experiencing my freedom within
        the business. One of the things that I can't really function without is
        going to a coffee place, opening my laptop and doing some work, and then
        not knowing where I'll go next. Maybe I'll go to the office - we have a
        nice office in Amsterdam - or go home and work a little bit more there,
        or go to a different coffee place, or have a nice walk and think about
        things. That kind of freedom is essential for me to function well.
      </p>

      <p>
        The more I go to coffee places, for example, the more successful it is.
        Although other habits like personal health are super important for the
        business too. I go to some kind of CrossFit training three times a week.
        Those are the moments where I know I wake up early because it's at eight
        o'clock in the morning. Then you go to your class, have a shower, and
        start working or have a coffee with your business partner or things like
        that.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's these little things that aren't very important by themselves, but
        within the whole work style, they make it really nice actually. You also
        create some moments with your business partner, for example. He goes to
        the same workouts, so afterwards you can have a coffee together and talk
        about random things. Those moments are actually important because you
        can talk about all sorts of things, not just the business.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think that's also what I kind of have in coffee places. You're not in
        a work environment, so you're not only thinking about work, work, work.
        You're also thinking about other things, like "Oh, there are other
        people around" or "That's a nice coffee" or "I see a nice bar" or
        whatever. So your mind is not just focused on one thing. I think that's
        important for having enough creativity in your business and making your
        life more fun as well.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What’s a unique strategy in your business that you’re particularly proud
        of?
      </h2>

      <p>
        I'm quite proud of the strategy regarding the free plan. We were
        thinking about whether it would work. I was scared to start a free plan
        because we have paying customers. If all those paying customers said,
        "Oh, nice, a free plan. Let's go to the free plan," and then we don't
        have paying customers anymore, that's not good. So it was a bit scary to
        do that.
      </p>

      <p>
        We launched it very low-key. We didn't really share it online and such.
        I think my first mention of the free plan was just a tweet where I asked
        for advice on the onboarding for our free plan, not really announcing it
        because I was too scared of sharing it. I didn't want people to use us
        for free instead of paying, so I was always a bit hesitant about that.
      </p>

      <p>
        We started with the free plan and then realised it wasn't giving us the
        same revenue increase that we normally got without a free plan. My
        business partner, Iron, who's more responsible for growth while I'm more
        responsible for product, started researching what we could do about it.
        He's really good at looking online for solutions and finding better
        options.
      </p>

      <p>
        He found this "reverse trial" solution. What it basically means is that
        during the trial, you can use everything in the product. But after the
        trial ends, the product is closed down and you need to either go with
        the free plan but delete all the features you were using (like added
        team members, bypassed ad blockers, etc.), or pay for a plan that fits
        your needs. There's a big red button saying, "Delete all my extra team
        members, delete all my extra websites," and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're trying this now. We don't have much data on it yet, but we already
        see it's working a lot better than the free trial or the freemium model
        we had before.
      </p>

      <p>
        These kinds of changes show how you can be very adaptive to whatever
        happens in your business. If this doesn't work out, we'll try something
        else. I'm really proud of our changes in strategy and that we can still
        change our whole business if we want to. Even after five years, we can
        rearrange the whole free plan. Maybe in a year, we'll realise the free
        plan didn't work out for us and we'll just kill it. That's a possibility
        too.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm really happy and proud of our process in changing these kinds of
        critical decisions in our business and that we're still agile enough to
        do this. It's much harder to convince people that a feature is really
        nice to use than to let them use the feature for free and let them
        discover for themselves if they like it or not. It just makes sense.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What book, podcast, or YouTube channel do you recommend the most, and
        why?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Yeah, when I first started, there were a lot of questions regarding what
        resources I use - videos I watch, podcasts I listen to, and so on. For
        me, it's relatively low - I don't read that many business books, I don't
        listen to a lot of business podcasts, and I don't watch many videos on
        how to grow your business and stuff like that. I use a lot of logical
        thinking in how things work. I use X (formerly Twitter), for example, to
        get some information from other businesses, like "Oh, this works for
        them. Okay, maybe I should try it too." But I know a lot of people are
        way more into gathering information from other sources.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm from a very stubborn family, so we always think we know what's best.
        That's definitely not the case - it's not the best solution, but we
        think it is. And that's also maybe where my eagerness to really learn
        from others is limited. I kind of have a feeling that I know what's
        good. That's also the biggest pitfall in my business - you need to
        listen to your customers to know what's best for them. So yeah, that's a
        difficult one. But I learned that along the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for other resources, I love to take my bike and go for a ride, or go
        for a run and listen to a podcast about history, stuff like that. But
        it's a very Dutch-oriented podcast, so I don't think it's relevant for
        the outside world. One of my favourite Dutch people is Maarten van
        Rossum. He has a similar last name to mine. He's very grumpy all the
        time, and that's kind of his thing. But he's actually a very nice person
        that puts you back on the ground with both feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        So if, I don't know, Russia is invading Ukraine or if something else is
        happening in the world, he will always try to explain what's going on.
        He'll explain that it's not as bad for the world as it seems, that these
        things have already happened in the past and that it's already been
        solved, or that we don't need to worry about it. I think the not
        worrying part is what I like the most about his podcast.
      </p>

      <p>
        He's just a very simple guy. He records the podcast in his car because
        he doesn't want to go to a podcast studio. There's another guy who's
        interviewing him, and he just talks. It's just nice. It's something I
        like to listen to, and it doesn't gain me much, but it's just easy
        entertainment with a bit of learning on how we handled things in the
        past.
      </p>

      <h2>What’s a mistake you’ve made, and what did it teach you?</h2>

      <p>
        Yeah, I think the biggest mistake that we made with Simple Analytics was
        in the very beginning. There are two things, actually.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first thing is when I launched, and I kept doing this for four
        years, I think. The only option was to just have a free trial and after
        the free trial, you would pay and then you're in or out. In hindsight,
        especially with the launch on Hacker News, I could have converted so
        many more people into something that's not being a paid platform, but
        would work better in the long term. I didn't have any email addresses of
        people that might be interested in our product; I would only have the 30
        new customers that ended up in our product and left their email address.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's kind of a balance between wanting paying customers and free
        customers. If you make it free, you don't really know if people are
        willing to pay. So there's this balance between knowing if people are
        willing to pay or wanting as many accounts on your website. In
        hindsight, I should have gone for the email addresses and accounts - I
        should have offered some kind of free plan or at least gotten more of
        those interested users.
      </p>

      <p>
        It scared me a bit because a lot of people around me were saying you
        should always have a paid plan because then you actually know if your
        product is being validated by people who want to pay. They said having a
        free plan with a lot of free users and converting those users into a
        paid plan is way too difficult. I'm not sure if that's true though.
        Maybe if I knew about reverse trials or something like that, I would
        have done it differently. That was one of the things I would see as a
        mistake if I had known more about running a business in the long term.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another mistake was we had one customer who had a list of things he
        really wanted in our product. I remember saying things like, "Oh, if
        this feature and that feature are there, then it's amazing." At that
        time, I was too stubborn. I was like, "No, we need to go in a different
        direction. We need to make it a bit simpler." But I think all the things
        on his list are now integrated into the tool, just not back then. I
        think that was not a great move. I should have listened to that feedback
        carefully and implemented all the things he said, because he was, in
        hindsight, our target customer. I was more focused on developers and
        other kinds of customers that I thought I knew better.
      </p>

      <p>
        So yeah, that's another mistake I made, I think. Listen to your
        customers a bit more, especially if those customers are not like
        yourself. You usually pick the things that you're already a fan of,
        right? So then you only pick things that you like, but you don't really
        listen to the other things the customer is suggesting. So I think that's
        an important thing to take into account.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What’s a common misconception people have about your industry or type of
        business?
      </h2>

      <p>
        I think my friends don't really know what I do. When I say I run a SaaS,
        they're like, "Yeah, well, what's a SaaS". And then when I say we have
        this MRR, they ask, "What is MRR?" Even when you explain MRR, it still
        doesn't make sense. They just compare it to their salary and ask how
        they should see it. So it's very interesting to talk with people who
        have no idea what SaaS is or what your business does.
      </p>

      <p>
        I always find it funny that most of my friends still don't know what I
        do. Even my girlfriend, I think she knows a bit, but it's still just a
        bit too far off for most people. So you're kind of working in this world
        that a lot of people are not part of. But online, there are enough
        people who are part of that world. You connect with them on X or
        something, and then you see them in real life and go to events and stuff
        like that. So there's always room for connecting with people who do
        understand what you're doing. And I think that's great. I think it's
        great to have two worlds where you can actually live in both and they
        don't understand each other. I think that's an interesting addition to
        businesses like this.
      </p>

      <p>
        A common misconception within the business, I think, is that a lot of
        people, especially at the start with Simple Analytics, don't understand
        that when you don't use cookies, you are still not allowed to track.
        They will come to you and say, "Oh, you're a cookieless solution, but I
        still want to attribute my sales campaign through all these funnels and
        steps, and I want to see what the user does in between, but without
        cookies." And then I always have to explain, "What you're describing is
        tracking a user. You can use different technology. You can use
        fingerprinting or local storage, which is another type of storage in the
        browser. But then you're just trying to work your way around it while
        actually using the same kind of technology."
      </p>

      <p>
        So it needs some convincing sometimes for certain businesses or people
        that you can't track a person because we don't use cookies. You can't
        track them another way either. And I think that is kind of changing in
        recent years too. There are a lot of businesses that now come to us and
        ask, "We don't want tracking. Can you help us with this?" And then I
        explain, "Okay, we don't do tracking across pages." And then usually
        they understand directly that that's also not why they're here. So most
        businesses now understand as well that we don't want tracking and they
        also know what it entails for them.
      </p>

      <p>
        But most people don't know, right? And it's also a complex thing. For
        most people, it's just the cookie banner. And that's the thing that you
        agree on. I'm trying to get people around me to hit the "no" button more
        often, but it's just the easiest way to click "yes" because then it's
        gone. But it's an annoying thing that needs to have a better solution
        than just clicking "yes" all the time.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What skill have you learned that’s had the biggest positive impact on
        your business?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Yeah, I think my most useful skill for the business is putting my
        creativity into work. If there's a problem where the ad blocker detects
        our server behind someone else's, those are the moments where I think,
        "Oh, I can build a solution for this because I can change it in a
        different way." There's always something complicated to fix, and in
        those moments, I really shine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, when a customer asks us something like, "Hey, we want to be able
        to do this," and I respond, "We can't really do it because of tracking,
        but we can offer you a similar way which works without tracking, and
        you'll still have relatable insights that you otherwise would have
        gotten." I think those things are really fun to do, and they're the
        things I bring to the business that really help.
      </p>

      <p>
        This also applies to the marketing side. When my business partner, Iron,
        has ideas about marketing, he asks me to check them. Usually, we can
        improve them significantly because I'm more of a technical person. So I
        can take it to the next level, and together we can go super far with
        whatever feature we think is useful for our customers or for attracting
        people.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe the creative part is the most valuable skill within a business
        and in running a business. You want to be creative to build a business,
        to stand out, and to have a story that people like to share. Otherwise,
        you can just work at a company. But if you run your own business, you
        need to be creative.
      </p>

      <p>
        My parents always told me that I was creative, and I think that's just
        something that stuck with me, so I always tried to be creative as well.
        I'm not sure what came first - maybe I was creative and got acknowledged
        for that, or someone said I was creative, and then I wanted to be more
        creative. But I think it's also a part of who I am.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, I was creative at school in a mischievous way. There were
        tests being handed out to different classes, but the test would always
        be the same across different classes. So I would ask the other classes,
        "Can you give me the test so we can learn it and then get straight A's?"
        That's what we did, but then I made a website around it where people
        could upload those tests. The whole school system didn't work anymore
        because the classes that didn't have the first test would all be super
        successful in completing all the tests. That didn't get me grounded, but
        it did raise some questions from the higher-ups in the school.
      </p>

      <p>
        Things like that, just trying to solve a problem in a creative way, have
        been part of my life since the start.
      </p>

      <h2>How do you approach long-term goals and planning?</h2>

      <p>
        Yeah, we plan our long-term goals with meetings. It's usually every
        quarter, but not strictly so. We try to have a meeting every quarter. My
        business partner and I go to an Airbnb somewhere in the Netherlands and
        sit there for a week. We try to figure out what we should do in the
        coming months. We always have a broad idea of where we want to go, and
        then we continue in that direction. Sometimes we need to go back
        completely and rethink everything. We ask ourselves, "How are we going
        from here?" instead of continuing in the direction we're already going.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the moment, we're at that stage. My business partner is in Cape Town,
        South Africa, for two months and will be back in a few weeks. Then we'll
        have another one of those sessions. We're going to go a bit deeper and
        think, "Okay, we want to grow, but let's go back to the starting level.
        Let's start with a blank canvas instead of going into the task list and
        seeing if we're following this vision or direction or mission."
        Sometimes you need to do that, and it's always a bit random when it
        happens.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have those meetings in place every three months, there's at least
        a moment where you really need to think about what you're going to do
        next. Otherwise, you're just doing whatever you were doing in the
        previous months, which can be a bit boring. You're also not going to get
        to the next level where you could have been if you'd put some thought
        into it. I think this works well for us.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once in a while, we think, "Okay, let's rethink it all and start over."
        We don't do that often. Usually, we know where we want to go, but
        especially this time, last year we focused so much on building the
        infrastructure for growth. We improved our server systems significantly,
        so we can handle much bigger customers. We added a free plan. We did so
        many things to make it work. So now this year is purely about growth -
        how can we make those things actually work for us? Then we can start a
        bit fresher at the beginning of the coming year.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think it's also good for your mind to be in a different location. It's
        similar to having sleepless nights when you bring your phone to bed.
        Eventually, you learn that in your bed, you're on your phone, so you
        don't have to sleep. But if you leave your phone out completely, your
        mind will think, "Oh, there's nothing else to do in bed, so let's go to
        sleep." The next time, you sleep better because you don't bring your
        phone every time.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think it's the same with working somewhere for weeks or months and
        then going somewhere else to be creative again. Your mind shifts and
        thinks, "We do the creative thing here and the work thing there." You
        become more creative because you're forcing your mind to change. Yeah,
        literally.
      </p>

      <h2>What do you do when you feel overwhelmed?</h2>

      <p>
        I have been feeling overwhelmed and stressed, especially not in the
        first year, but also in the second and third years. I saw so many
        businesses progressing faster than I was, and I became fixated on their
        success compared to mine. That's super stressful because you can't do
        anything about it. It's completely out of your hands. You see someone
        being more successful, and then you think, "Oh, but I'm not there yet. I
        need to work harder." But that drive to work harder isn't coming from a
        place of building a better product; it's more from wanting to be as good
        as those other businesses, for example. I think that's quite stressful.
      </p>

      <p>
        The moment where that stress ended was because I was doing everything
        myself. I was building the product, doing the marketing, handling the
        administration - everything that comes with running a business. At some
        point, I felt stuck with how to grow further and how to build enough
        features. If I was working on features, I would feel like I wasn't
        working on marketing. If I worked on marketing, I would think that those
        features needed to be finished too. There was always this feeling of
        never being enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I found my business partner, and he started working on the
        marketing part. Suddenly, I only had to take care of the product side,
        and he handled the marketing. That was such a shift in my brain and
        mental health. I changed to thinking, "Oh, I can now focus on whatever
        I'm doing in the product and still feel like that's okay." Instead of
        always feeling like I was missing out or not putting enough time or
        effort into the other aspects of the business.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me, getting another business partner who really contributes to the
        same values but also enjoys the things that I don't like as much was
        crucial. He loves to build things in marketing and work on growth
        strategies, while I love to build a great product and a great business.
        It's fantastic if you have those separate qualities inside a business
        and in a partnership.
      </p>

      <p>
        My mental health was basically perfect after he joined, just because
        it's not like fighting the big guys with the feeling that you're not
        doing enough. It's just that you're doing enough, and that's a great
        feeling.
      </p>

      <h2>
        If you lost your business today, what's the first thing you'd focus on
        to get back to where you are now?
      </h2>

      <p>
        So what I would do to get back to this level of business is, of course,
        applying all the learnings that I applied here.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first learning is that instead of starting by myself, I would start
        with two. First thing I would go to Iron like, "Hey, let's start a new
        business and let's build it together." So that's the first thing I would
        do differently - start together instead of solo.
      </p>

      <p>
        That way, maybe it's not with every business partner, right? I just have
        luck that I have a good business partner, and I want to start the next
        business with him too. But that would be a big difference, I think, and
        way better for growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        I would listen better to my customers, so building a better feedback
        system from the start instead of like during five years in. I think
        that's an important difference.
      </p>

      <p>
        I would definitely try to keep it business-to-business. That's way, way
        easier than selling to consumers. So yeah, if you want to make money,
        you probably want to go business-to-business.
      </p>

      <p>
        I wouldn't be afraid that much anymore from enterprise. Like before, I
        started, I would have an enterprise business button on my website. They
        contact us, but maybe the next business would be only enterprise because
        it's way easier to solve a problem for enterprise and let them pay for
        it, than trying to create a solution for people that don't really think
        they have a problem yet. Because that needs way more convincing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The easiest sales are from enterprises that come to us and say, "Hey, we
        have this problem. I think you have the solution." And then you just
        name a number and they say, "Okay, we're happy with it or not." That's
        an easier sales process. It's not that all those sales processes work
        fine, but it's an easier way to get more money faster, I think.
      </p>

      <p>
        But at the same time, you also want to build a product that you put love
        in, and people are going to notice that. So also for your own
        motivation, you probably want to put love in the product. In the next
        business, I might balance between that a bit more, between putting love
        in the business and still going fast for the enterprise customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I still wouldn't - like the things that I would do the same - is
        keeping VC funding out. Staying bootstrapped. So also being okay with
        not going that fast.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm growing Simple Analytics now for five years. We're now at 36K MRR,
        which is, for us, it's great. But if you want to be there in one year,
        you need to have a different strategy than I do have now. I'm not sure
        if I want to change that part. I kind of like our strategy of building a
        business, growing it, and not going from one to a thousand in a few
        days.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I think I would definitely focus on something AI-related. I feel so
        much eagerness to do something with AI. And yeah, it's of course also
        this nice bubble we live in now. Everybody in the entrepreneurial areas
        is doing something with AI. There's a lot of successful businesses. So
        maybe something like that, that would be really cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        But yeah, that's something for the future. And I think those kinds of
        tools are easier to be sold than an analytics platform. Like an
        analytics platform, the moment where you buy it is not a moment where
        you have to contact the people behind it, usually. What I'm trying to
        say is if you reach out to a person and say, "Hey, we are a great
        analytics tool," and they say, "Yeah, we are super nice," but we're not
        right now busy with or working on changing our analytics tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I think with other products, it's way easier. With ours, it's like
        at some point they will need it, and then they need to reach out to you.
        So it's a bit the other way around. You can't really do cold sales or
        something because people are not looking for an analytics tool at that
        time. They're just like, I don't know, doing something else.
      </p>

      <p>
        But then two months later, they realise, "Oh, our cookie banner is
        blocking 20% of our customers." Maybe you want to know it and then they
        need an analytics platform like ours. And yeah, that's a bit different
        from other businesses, but I'm drifting off a bit. But yeah, just
        thought I needed to say that.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What's a controversial opinion you have about starting a business?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Yeah, I think a lot of people make the mistake of trying all new things
        when they start a business. That's probably the biggest mistake you can
        make. Just use the things you already know.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, I'm a developer by trade, and that's a common pitfall for
        developers. They have a new framework or language they want to try, and
        they think, "Oh, I have a new project. I can use all this new technology
        to build it." But at the end, you're just stuck because you didn't find
        the solution for your problem in this framework. You're trying to build
        a business - nobody cares about your framework. People care about how it
        looks, if it loads okay, and if it solves their problem. If it does,
        then it's a good product. I needed to unlearn that quite a bit as a
        developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another thing is that a lot of people want to grow fast, and I think
        it's a good way to see what's important in your business. But I don't
        think it's the best way to have that as your only goal. Try to find a
        different goal, like making the world more privacy-friendly, or
        something a bit bigger than just numbers. Although I'm not practicing
        what I preach because we have an open page with all our numbers shared,
        and we share new milestones online. It's a bit of both, I think. Those
        open numbers can be used for perfect marketing, right? There's always a
        new thing you can share.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think it's important to have something that keeps you motivated for
        running a business for a longer period of time. Running a business for
        one year, I think everybody can do that. Running it for five years is
        really much more complicated, especially if you're not that invested in
        the values of the business. If your main motivation is money and it
        plateaus a bit, or goes down a bit, you're instantly unhappy. But if
        your motivation also comes from wanting to make the world a more
        privacy-friendly place, then I can say with my free plan, "Oh, a lot
        more people are using us now instead of Google Analytics, I'm
        contributing to that goal already." So if I dip a bit in MRR, that's
        okay. It's not the end of the world because I'm still getting motivation
        from other things as well. I think that's an important thing to consider
        when you're having a business or starting a business.
      </p>

      <p>
        You feel it more as well. Like we talked about earlier, the story and
        the people behind it. If you feel that someone is really motivated for a
        certain cause or really enjoys talking or getting things out of other
        people, then you're going to feel that. I think that's an important
        thing to have, because then people see more of the value or something. I
        don't know.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What is a truth about business or life that you have learned that you
        wish more people understood?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Yeah, the truth about my life, I think, is that being stubborn is great,
        but this is a bit dangerous because it's not for everybody. For people
        like me, it's brilliant, because I'm super stubborn and, coming from a
        stubborn family, this really helps me make decisions in my life.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, I started digital nomading. Nobody in my area was doing
        that, so it was weird. I started my own business. Not many people were
        doing it. I wanted to drop out of school. That was not something that
        people did. There are a lot of things that may make you not fit in with
        the normal world. But it doesn't mean that there's no place for you in
        that world.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me, there was this one teacher in school that understood me. He was
        a really fun teacher. When I was coming late to class, he would say,
        "Hey, why are you already in class? Because if you're late, you're
        registered as being late. So why not come in the last five minutes? Then
        you can sleep longer and you still have your 'being late in class'
        checkbox next to your name. So it doesn't matter." I was like, "Yeah, I
        like this kind of thinking." He was the one teacher that understood how
        you can think about life in a slightly different way than just being
        rigid in the structure that people set out for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Breaking out of the structure might feel uncomfortable, or people might
        feel it's not expected of them, but I think most of the time it's great
        because it gives you a much better feeling and you feel so much more
        like yourself. I think that's super important and way more important
        than following whatever structure is being set in place for you on this
        planet.
